Preface

Repeated requests from Computer Science and IT engineering
students who are the readers of our previous books encouraged
us to write this book on machine learning. The concept of
machine learning and the huge potential of its application is
still niche knowledge and not so well-spread among the
student community. So, we thought of writing this book
specifically for techies, college students, and junior managers
so that they understood the machine learning concepts easily.
They should not only use the machine learning software
packages, but understand the concepts behind those packages.
The application of machine learning is getting boosted day by
day. From recommending products to the buyers, to predicting
the future real estate market, to helping medical practitioners
in diagnosis, to optimizing energy consumption, thus helping
the cause of Green Earth, machine learning is finding its utility
in every sphere of life.

Due care was taken to write this book in simple English and

to present the machine learning concepts in an easily
understandable way which can be used as a textbook for both
graduate and advanced undergraduate classes in machine
learning or as a reference text.

Whom Is This Book For?

Readers of this book will gain a thorough understanding of
machine learning concepts. Not only students but also

software professionals will find a variety of techniques with
sufficient discussions in this book that cater to the needs of the
professional environments. Technical managers will get an
insight into weaving machine learning into the overall
software engineering process. Students, developers, and
technical managers with a basic background in computer
science will find the material in this book easily readable.

How This Book Is Organized?

Each chapter starts with an introductory paragraph, which
gives overview of the chapter along with a chapter-coverage
table listing out the topics covered in the chapter. Sample
questions at the end of the chapter helps the students to
prepare for the examination. Discussion points and Points to
Ponder given inside the chapters help to clarify and understand
the chapters easily and also explore the thinking ability of the
students and professionals.

A recap summary is given at the end of each chapter for
quick review of the topics. Throughout this book, you will see
many exercises and discussion questions. Please don�t skip
these � they are important in order to understand the machine
learning concepts fully.

This book starts with an introduction to Machine Learning

which lays the theoretical foundation for the remaining
chapters. Modelling, Feature engineering, and basic
probability are discussed as chapters before entering into the
world of machine learning which helps to grip the machine
learning concepts easily at a later point of time.

Bonus topics of machine learning exercise with multiple
examples are discussed in Machine learning language of R &

Python. Appendix A discusses Programming Machine
Learning in R and Appendix B discusses Programming
Machine Learning in Python.

Introduction to Machine Learning

OBJECTIVE OF THE CHAPTER :

The objective of this chapter is to venture into the arena of
machine learning. New comers struggle a lot to understand
the philosophy of machine learning. Also, they do not
know where to start from and which problem could be and
should be solved using machine learning tools and
techniques. This chapter intends to give the new comers a
starting point to the journey in machine learning. It starts
from a historical journey in this field and takes it forward
to give a glimpse of the modern day applications.

1.1 INTRODUCTION

It has been more than 20 years since a computer program
defeated the reigning world champion in a game which is
considered to need a lot of intelligence to play. The computer
program was IBM�s Deep Blue and it defeated world chess
champion, Gary Kasparov. That was the time, probably, when
the most number of people gave serious attention to a fast-

evolving field in computer science or more specifically
artificial intelligence � i.e. machine learning (ML).

As of today, machine learning is a mature technology area

finding its application in almost every sphere of life. It can
recommend toys to toddlers much in the same way as it can
suggest a technology book to a geek or a rich title in literature
to a writer. It predicts the future market to help amateur traders
compete with seasoned stock traders. It helps an oncologist
find whether a tumour is malignant or benign. It helps in
optimizing energy consumption thus helping the cause of
Green Earth. Google has become one of the front-runners
focusing a lot of its research on machine learning and artificial
intelligence � Google self-driving car and Google Brain being
two most ambitious projects of Google in its journey of
innovation in the field of machine learning. In a nutshell,
machine learning has become a way of life, no matter
whichever sphere of life we closely look at. But where did it
all start from?

The foundation of machine learning started in the 18th and

19th centuries. The first related work dates back to 1763. In
that year, Thomas Bayes�s work �An Essay towards solving a
Problem in the Doctrine of Chances� was published two years
after his death. This is the work underlying Bayes Theorem, a
fundamental work on which a number of algorithms of
machine learning is based upon. In 1812, the Bayes theorem
was actually formalized by the French mathematician Pierre-
Simon Laplace. The method of least squares, which is the
foundational concept to solve regression problems, was
formalized in 1805. In 1913, Andrey Markov came up with the
concept of Markov chains.

However, the real start of focused work in the field of
machine learning is considered to be Alan Turing�s seminal
work in 1950. In his paper �Computing Machinery and
Intelligence� (Mind, New Series, Vol. 59, No. 236, Oct., 1950,
pp. 433�460), Turing posed the question �Can machines
think?� or in other words, �Do machines have intelligence?�.
He was the first to propose that machines can �learn� and
become artificially intelligent. In 1952, Arthur Samuel of IBM
laboratory started working on machine learning programs, and
first developed programs that could play Checkers. In 1957,
Frank Rosenblatt designed the first neural network program
simulating the human brain. From then on, for the next 50
years, the journey of machine learning has been fascinating. A
number of machine learning algorithms were formulated by
different researchers, e.g. the nearest neighbour algorithm in
1969, recurrent neural network in 1982, support vector
machines and random forest algorithms in 1995. The latest
feather in the cap of machine learning development has been
Google�s AlphaGo program, which has beaten professional
human Go player using machine learning techniques.

Points to Ponder

While Deep Blue was searching some 200 million positions per second,
Kasparov was searching not more than 5�10 positions probably, per
second. Yet he played almost at the same level. This clearly shows that
humans have some trick up their sleeve that computers could not master
yet.
Go is a board game which can be played by two players. It was
invented in China almost 2500 years ago and is considered to be the
oldest board game. Though it has relatively simple rules, Go is a very
complex game (more complex than chess) because of its larger board
size and more number of possible moves.

The evolution of machine learning from 1950 is depicted in

Figure 1.1.

The rapid development in the area of machine learning has
triggered a question in everyone�s mind � can machines learn
better than human? To find its answer, the first step would be
to understand what learning is from a human perspective.
Then, more light can be shed on what machine learning is. In
the end, we need to know whether machine learning has
already surpassed or has the potential to surpass human
learning in every facet of life.

FIG. 1.1 Evolution of machine learning

1.2 WHAT IS HUMAN LEARNING?

In cognitive science, learning is typically referred to as the
process of gaining information through observation. And why
do we need to learn? In our daily life, we need to carry out
multiple activities. It may be a task as simple as walking down
the street or doing the homework. Or it may be some complex
task like deciding the angle in which a rocket should be
launched so that it can have a particular trajectory. To do a task
in a proper way, we need to have prior information on one or
more things related to the task. Also, as we keep learning more
or in other words acquiring more information, the efficiency in
doing the tasks keep improving. For example, with more
knowledge, the ability to do homework with less number of
mistakes increases. In the same way, information from past
rocket launches helps in taking the right precautions and
makes more successful rocket launch. Thus, with more
learning, tasks can be performed more efficiently.

1.3 TYPES OF HUMAN LEARNING

Thinking intuitively, human learning happens in one of the
three ways � (1) either somebody who is an expert in the
subject directly teaches us, (2) we build our own notion
indirectly based on what we have learnt from the expert in the
past, or (3) we do it ourselves, may be after multiple attempts,
some being unsuccessful. The first type of learning, we may
call, falls under the category of learning directly under expert
guidance, the second type falls under learning guided by
knowledge gained from experts and the third type is learning
by self or self-learning. Let�s look at each of these types
deeply using real-life examples and try to understand what
they mean.

1.3.1 Learning under expert guidance

An infant may inculcate certain traits and characteristics,
learning straight from its guardians. He calls his hand, a
�hand�, because that is the information he gets from his
parents. The sky is �blue� to him because that is what his
parents have taught him. We say that the baby �learns� things
from his parents.

The next phase of life is when the baby starts going to
school. In school, he starts with basic familiarization of
alphabets and digits. Then the baby learns how to form words
from the alphabets and numbers from the digits. Slowly more
complex learning happens in the form of sentences,
paragraphs, complex mathematics, science, etc. The baby is
able to learn all these things from his teacher who already has
knowledge on these areas.

Then starts higher studies where the person learns about

more complex, application-oriented skills. Engineering

students get skilled in one of the disciplines like civil,
computer science, electrical, mechanical, etc. medical students
learn about anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, etc. There are
some experts, in general the teachers, in the respective field
who have in-depth subject matter knowledge, who help the
students in learning these skills.

Then the person starts working as a professional in some
field. Though he might have gone through enough theoretical
learning in the respective field, he still needs to learn more
about the hands-on application of the knowledge that he has
acquired. The professional mentors, by virtue of the
knowledge that they have gained through years of hands-on
experience, help all new comers in the field to learn on-job.

In all phases of life of a human being, there is an element of
guided learning. This learning is imparted by someone, purely
because of the fact that he/she has already gathered the
knowledge by virtue of his/her experience in that field. So
guided learning is the process of gaining information from a
person having sufficient knowledge due to the past experience.

1.3.2 Learning guided by knowledge gained from experts

An essential part of learning also happens with the knowledge
which has been imparted by teacher or mentor at some point of
time in some other form/context. For example, a baby can
group together all objects of same colour even if his parents
have not specifically taught him to do so. He is able to do so
because at some point of time or other his parents have told
him which colour is blue, which is red, which is green, etc. A
grown-up kid can select one odd word from a set of words
because it is a verb and other words being all nouns. He could
do this because of his ability to label the words as verbs or

nouns, taught by his English teacher long back. In a
professional role, a person is able to make out to which
customers he should market a campaign from the knowledge
about preference that was given by his boss long back.

In all these situations, there is no direct learning. It is some

past information shared on some different context, which is
used as a learning to make decisions.

1.3.3 Learning by self

In many situations, humans are left to learn on their own. A
classic example is a baby learning to walk through obstacles.
He bumps on to obstacles and falls down multiple times till he
learns that whenever there is an obstacle, he needs to cross
over it. He faces the same challenge while learning to ride a
cycle as a kid or drive a car as an adult. Not all things are
taught by others. A lot of things need to be learnt only from
mistakes made in the past. We tend to form a check list on
things that we should do, and things that we should not do,
based on our experiences.

1.4 WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING?

Before answering the question �What is machine learning?�
more fundamental questions that peep into one�s mind are

Do machines really learn?
If so, how do they learn?
Which problem can we consider as a well-posed learning problem? What are
the important features that are required to well-define a learning problem?

At the onset, it is important to formalize the definition of
machine learning. This will itself address the first question, i.e.
if machines really learn. There are multiple ways to define
machine learning. But the one which is perhaps most relevant,

concise and accepted universally is the one stated by Tom M.
Mitchell, Professor of Machine Learning Department, School
of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. Tom M.
Mitchell has defined machine learning as

�A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to
some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at
tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.�

What this essentially means is that a machine can be

considered to learn if it is able to gather experience by doing a
certain task and improve its performance in doing the similar
tasks in the future. When we talk about past experience, it
means past data related to the task. This data is an input to the
machine from some source.

In the context of the learning to play checkers, E represents

the experience of playing the game, T represents the task of
playing checkers and P is the performance measure indicated
by the percentage of games won by the player. The same
mapping can be applied for any other machine learning
problem, for example, image classification problem. In context
of image classification, E represents the past data with images
having labels or assigned classes (for example whether the
image is of a class cat or a class dog or a class elephant etc.), T
is the task of assigning class to new, unlabelled images and P
is the performance measure indicated by the percentage of
images correctly classified.

The first step in any project is defining your problem. Even

if the most powerful algorithm is used, the results will be
meaningless if the wrong problem is solved.

1.4.1 How do machines learn?

The basic machine learning process can be divided into three
parts.

1. Data Input: Past data or information is utilized as a basis for future

decision-making

2. Abstraction: The input data is represented in a broader way through the

underlying algorithm

3. Generalization: The abstracted representation is generalized to form a

framework for making decisions

Figure 1.2 is a schematic representation of the machine

learning process.

FIG. 1.2 Process of machine learning

Let�s put the things in perspective of the human learning
process and try to understand the machine learning process
more clearly. Reason is, in some sense, machine learning
process tries to emulate the process in which humans learn to a
large extent.

Let�s consider the situation of typical process of learning
from classroom and books and preparing for the examination.
It is a tendency of many students to try and memorize (we
often call it �learn by heart�) as many things as possible. This
may work well when the scope of learning is not so vast. Also,
the kinds of questions which are asked in the examination are
pretty much simple and straightforward. The questions can be
answered by simply writing the same things which have been
memorized. However, as the scope gets broader and the

questions asked in the examination gets more complex, the
strategy of memorizing doesn�t work well. The number of
topics may get too vast for a student to memorize. Also, the
capability of memorizing varies from student to student.
Together with that, since the questions get more complex, a
direct reproduction of the things memorized may not help. The
situation continues to get worse as the student graduates to
higher classes.

So, what we see in the case of human learning is that just by

great memorizing and perfect recall, i.e. just based on
knowledge input, students can do well in the examinations
only till a certain stage. Beyond that, a better learning strategy
needs to be adopted:

1. to be able to deal with the vastness of the subject matter and the related

issues in memorizing it

2. to be able to answer questions where a direct answer has not been learnt

A good option is to figure out the key points or ideas
amongst a vast pool of knowledge. This helps in creating an
outline of topics and a conceptual mapping of those outlined
topics with the entire knowledge pool. For example, a broad
pool of knowledge may consist of all living animals and their
characteristics such as whether they live in land or water,
whether they lay eggs, whether they have scales or fur or none,
etc. It is a difficult task for any student to memorize the
characteristics of all living animals � no matter how much
photographic memory he/she may possess. It is better to draw
a notion about the basic groups that all living animals belong
to and the characteristics which define each of the basic
groups. The basic groups of animals are invertebrates and
vertebrates. Vertebrates are further grouped as mammals,
reptiles, amphibians, fishes, and birds. Here, we have mapped
animal groups and their salient characteristics.

1. Invertebrate: Do not have backbones and skeletons
2. Vertebrate

1. Fishes: Always live in water and lay eggs
2. Amphibians: Semi-aquatic i.e. may live in water or land; smooth

skin; lay eggs

3. Reptiles: Semi-aquatic like amphibians; scaly skin; lay eggs;

cold-blooded

4. Birds: Can fly; lay eggs; warm-blooded
5. Mammals: Have hair or fur; have milk to feed their young;

warm-blooded

This makes it easier to memorize as the scope now reduces
to know the animal groups that the animals belong to. Rest of
the answers about the characteristics of the animals may be
derived from the concept of mapping animal groups and their
characteristics.

Moving to the machine learning paradigm, the vast pool of

knowledge is available from the data input. However, rather
than using it in entirety, a concept map, much in line with the
animal group to characteristic mapping explained above, is
drawn from the input data. This is nothing but knowledge
abstraction as performed by the machine. In the end, the
abstracted mapping from the input data can be applied to make
critical conclusions. For example, if the group of an animal is
given, understanding of the characteristics can be
automatically made. Reversely, if the characteristic of an
unknown animal is given, a definite conclusion can be made
about the animal group it belongs to. This is generalization in
context of machine learning.

1.4.1.1 Abstraction

During the machine learning process, knowledge is fed in the
form of input data. However, the data cannot be used in the
original shape and form. As we saw in the example above,
abstraction helps in deriving a conceptual map based on the

input data. This map, or a model as it is known in the machine
learning paradigm, is summarized knowledge representation of
the raw data. The model may be in any one of the following
forms

Computational blocks like if/else rules
Mathematical equations
Specific data structures like trees or graphs
Logical groupings of similar observations

The choice of the model used to solve a specific learning
problem is a human task. The decision related to the choice of
model is taken based on multiple aspects, some of which are
listed below:

The type of problem to be solved: Whether the problem is related to forecast
or prediction, analysis of trend, understanding the different segments or
groups of objects, etc.
Nature of the input data: How exhaustive the input data is, whether the data
has no values for many fields, the data types, etc.
Domain of the problem: If the problem is in a business critical domain with a
high rate of data input and need for immediate inference, e.g. fraud detection
problem in banking domain.

1

2

Once the model is chosen, the next task is to fit the model
based on the input data. Let�s understand this with an example.
In a case where the model is represented by a mathematical
equation, say �y = c  + c x� (the model is known as simple
linear regression which we will study in a later chapter), based
on the input data, we have to find out the values of c  and c .
2
Otherwise, the equation (or the model) is of no use. So, fitting
the model, in this case, means finding the values of the
unknown coefficients or constants of the equation or the
model. This process of fitting the model based on the input
data is known as training. Also, the input data based on which
the model is being finalized is known as training data.

1

1.4.1.2 Generalization

The first part of machine learning process is abstraction i.e.
abstract the knowledge which comes as input data in the form
of a model. However, this abstraction process, or more
popularly training the model, is just one part of machine
learning. The other key part is to tune up the abstracted
knowledge to a form which can be used to take future
decisions. This is achieved as a part of generalization. This
part is quite difficult to achieve. This is because the model is
trained based on a finite set of data, which may possess a
limited set of characteristics. But when we want to apply the
model to take decision on a set of unknown data, usually
termed as test data, we may encounter two problems:

1. The trained model is aligned with the training data too much, hence

may not portray the actual trend.

2. The test data possess certain characteristics apparently unknown to the

training data.

Hence, a precise approach of decision-making will not
work. An approximate or heuristic approach, much like gut-
feeling-based decision-making in human beings, has to be
adopted. This approach has the risk of not making a correct
decision � quite obviously because certain assumptions that
are made may not be true in reality. But just like machines,
same mistakes can be made by humans too when a decision is
made based on intuition or gut-feeling � in a situation where
exact reason-based decision-making is not possible.

1.4.2 Well-posed learning problem

For defining a new problem, which can be solved using
machine learning, a simple framework, highlighted below, can
be used. This framework also helps in deciding whether the
problem is a right candidate to be solved using machine
learning. The framework involves answering three questions:

1. What is the problem?
2. Why does the problem need to be solved?
3. How to solve the problem?

Step 1: What is the Problem?

A number of information should be collected to know what

is the problem.

Informal description of the problem, e.g. I need a

program that will prompt the next word as and when I type a
word.

Formalism

Use Tom Mitchell�s machine learning formalism stated above
to define the T, P, and E for the problem.

For example:

Task (T): Prompt the next word when I type a word.
Experience (E): A corpus of commonly used English words and phrases.
Performance (P): The number of correct words prompted considered as a
percentage (which in machine learning paradigm is known as learning
accuracy).

Assumptions - Create a list of assumptions about the

problem.

Similar problems

What other problems have you seen or can you think of that
are similar to the problem that you are trying to solve?

Step 2: Why does the problem need to be solved?

Motivation

What is the motivation for solving the problem? What
requirement will it fulfil?

For example, does this problem solve any long-standing

business issue like finding out potentially fraudulent
transactions? Or the purpose is more trivial like trying to
suggest some movies for upcoming weekend.

Solution benefits

Consider the benefits of solving the problem. What
capabilities does it enable?

It is important to clearly understand the benefits of solving

the problem. These benefits can be articulated to sell the
project.

Solution use

How will the solution to the problem be used and the life time
of the solution is expected to have?

Step 3: How would I solve the problem?

Try to explore how to solve the problem manually.

Detail out step-by-step data collection, data preparation, and

program design to solve the problem. Collect all these details
and update the previous sections of the problem definition,
especially the assumptions.

Summary

Step 1: What is the problem? Describe the problem informally and
formally and list assumptions and similar problems.
Step 2: Why does the problem need to be solved? List the motivation for
solving the problem, the benefits that the solution will provide and how the

solution will be used.
Step 3: How would I solve the problem? Describe how the problem would
be solved manually to flush domain knowledge.

built in 1998. Although most models sold were dog-like,
other inspirations included lion-cubs. It could express
emotions and could also recognize its owner. In 2006,
Aibo was added to the Carnegie Mellon University�s
�Robot Hall of Fame�. A new generation of Aibo was
launched in Japan in January 2018.

1.5 TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING

As highlighted in Figure 1.3, Machine learning can be
classified into three broad categories:

1. Supervised learning � Also called predictive learning. A machine
predicts the class of unknown objects based on prior class-related
information of similar objects.

2. Unsupervised learning � Also called descriptive learning. A machine

finds patterns in unknown objects by grouping similar objects together.
3. Reinforcement learning � A machine learns to act on its own to achieve

the given goals.

FIG. 1.3 Types of machine learning

Did you know?

Many video games are based on artificial intelligence
technique called Expert System. This technique can imitate
areas of human behaviour, with a goal to mimic the human
ability of senses, perception, and reasoning.

1.5.1 Supervised learning

The major motivation of supervised learning is to learn from
past information. So what kind of past information does the
machine need for supervised learning? It is the information
about the task which the machine has to execute. In context of
the definition of machine learning, this past information is the
experience. Let�s try to understand it with an example.

Say a machine is getting images of different objects as input

and the task is to segregate the images by either shape or
colour of the object. If it is by shape, the images which are of
round-shaped objects need to be separated from images of

triangular-shaped objects, etc. If the segregation needs to
happen based on colour, images of blue objects need to be
separated from images of green objects. But how can the
machine know what is round shape, or triangular shape? Same
way, how can the machine distinguish image of an object
based on whether it is blue or green in colour? A machine is
very much like a little child whose parents or adults need to
guide him with the basic information on shape and colour
before he can start doing the task. A machine needs the basic
information to be provided to it. This basic input, or the
experience in the paradigm of machine learning, is given in the
form of training data . Training data is the past information
on a specific task. In context of the image segregation
problem, training data will have past data on different aspects
or features on a number of images, along with a tag on
whether the image is round or triangular, or blue or green in
colour. The tag is called � label� and we say that the training
data is labelled in case of supervised learning.

Figure 1.4 is a simple depiction of the supervised learning

process. Labelled training data containing past information
comes as an input. Based on the training data, the machine
builds a predictive model that can be used on test data to
assign a label for each record in the test data.

FIG. 1.4 Supervised learning

Some examples of supervised learning are

Predicting the results of a game
Predicting whether a tumour is malignant or benign
Predicting the price of domains like real estate, stocks, etc.
Classifying texts such as classifying a set of emails as spam or non-spam

Now, let�s consider two of the above examples, say
�predicting whether a tumour is malignant or benign� and
�predicting price of domains such as real estate�. Are these two
problems same in nature? The answer is �no�. Though both of
them are prediction problems, in one case we are trying to
predict which category or class an unknown data belongs to
whereas in the other case we are trying to predict an absolute
value and not a class. When we are trying to predict a
categorical or nominal variable, the problem is known as a
classification problem. Whereas when we are trying to predict
a real-valued variable, the problem falls under the category of
regression.

Note:

Supervised machine learning is as good as the data used to
train it. If the training data is of poor quality, the prediction
will also be far from being precise.

Let�s try to understand these two areas of supervised
learning, i.e. classification and regression in more details.

1.5.1.1 Classification

Let�s discuss how to segregate the images of objects based on
the shape . If the image is of a round object, it is put under one
category, while if the image is of a triangular object, it is put
under another category. In which category the machine should
put an image of unknown category, also called a test data in
machine learning parlance, depends on the information it gets
from the past data, which we have called as training data.
Since the training data has a label or category defined for each
and every image, the machine has to map a new image or test
data to a set of images to which it is similar to and assign the
same label or category to the test data.

So we observe that the whole problem revolves around

assigning a label or category or class to a test data based on the
label or category or class information that is imparted by the
training data. Since the target objective is to assign a class
label, this type of problem as classification problem. Figure
1.5 depicts the typical process of classification.

FIG. 1.5 Classification

There are number of popular machine learning algorithms
which help in solving classification problems. To name a few,
Na�ve Bayes, Decision tree, and k-Nearest Neighbour
algorithms are adopted by many machine learning
practitioners.

A critical classification problem in context of banking
domain is identifying potential fraudulent transactions. Since
there are millions of transactions which have to be scrutinized
and assured whether it might be a fraud transaction, it is not
possible for any human being to carry out this task. Machine
learning is effectively leveraged to do this task and this is a
classic case of classification. Based on the past transaction
data, specifically the ones labelled as fraudulent, all new
incoming transactions are marked or labelled as normal or

suspicious. The suspicious transactions are subsequently
segregated for a closer review.

In summary, classification is a type of supervised learning

where a target feature, which is of type categorical, is
predicted for test data based on the information imparted by
training data. The target categorical feature is known as class.

Some typical classification problems include:

Image classification
Prediction of disease
Win�loss prediction of games
Prediction of natural calamity like earthquake, flood, etc.
Recognition of handwriting

Machine learning saves life � ML can spot 52% of breast cancer cells, a
year before patients are diagnosed.
US Postal Service uses machine learning for handwriting recognition.
Facebook�s news feed uses machine learning to personalize each
member�s feed.

1.5.1.2. Regression

In linear regression, the objective is to predict numerical
features like real estate or stock price, temperature, marks in
an examination, sales revenue, etc. The underlying predictor
variable and the target variable are continuous in nature. In
case of linear regression, a straight line relationship is �fitted�
between the predictor variables and the target variables, using
the statistical concept of least squares method. As in the case
of least squares method, the sum of square of error between

actual and predicted values of the target variable is tried to be
minimized. In case of simple linear regression, there is only
one predictor variable whereas in case of multiple linear
regression, multiple predictor variables can be included in the
model.

Let�s take the example of yearly budgeting exercise of the
sales managers. They have to give sales prediction for the next
year based on sales figure of previous years vis-�-vis
investment being put in. Obviously, the data related to past as
well as the data to be predicted are continuous in nature. In a
basic approach, a simple linear regression model can be
applied with investment as predictor variable and sales
revenue as the target variable.

Figure 1.6 shows a typical simple regression model, where
regression line is fitted based on values of target variable with
respect to different values of predictor variable. A typical
linear regression model can be represented in the form �

where �x� is the predictor variable and �y� is the target variable.

The input data come from a famous multivariate data set
named Iris introduced by the British statistician and biologist
Ronald Fisher. The data set consists of 50 samples from each
of three species of Iris � Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris
versicolor. Four features were measured for each sample �
sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These
features can uniquely discriminate the different species of the
flower.

The Iris data set is typically used as a training data for
solving the classification problem of predicting the flower
species based on feature values. However, we can also
demonstrate regression using this data set, by predicting the
value of one feature using another feature as predictor. In
Figure 1.6, petal length is a predictor variable which, when
fitted in the simple linear regression model, helps in predicting
the value of the target variable sepal length.

Typical applications of regression can be seen in

Demand forecasting in retails
Sales prediction for managers
Price prediction in real estate
Weather forecast
Skill demand forecast in job market

1.5.2 Unsupervised learning

Unlike supervised learning, in unsupervised learning, there is
no labelled training data to learn from and no prediction to be

made. In unsupervised learning, the objective is to take a
dataset as input and try to find natural groupings or patterns
within the data elements or records. Therefore, unsupervised
learning is often termed as descriptive model and the process
of unsupervised learning is referred as pattern discovery or
knowledge discovery. One critical application of
unsupervised learning is customer segmentation.

Clustering is the main type of unsupervised learning. It
intends to group or organize similar objects together. For that
reason, objects belonging to the same cluster are quite similar
to each other while objects belonging to different clusters are
quite dissimilar. Hence, the objective of clustering to discover
the intrinsic grouping of unlabelled data and form clusters, as
depicted in Figure 1.7. Different measures of similarity can be
applied for clustering. One of the most commonly adopted
similarity measure is distance. Two data items are considered
as a part of the same cluster if the distance between them is
less. In the same way, if the distance between the data items is
high, the items do not generally belong to the same cluster.
This is also known as distance-based clustering. Figure 1.8
depicts the process of clustering at a high level.

FIG. 1.7 Distance-based clustering

Other than clustering of data and getting a summarized view

from it, one more variant of unsupervised learning is
association analysis. As a part of association analysis, the
association between data elements is identified. Let�s try to
understand the approach of association analysis in context of
one of the most common examples, i.e. market basket analysis
as shown in Figure 1.9. From past transaction data in a grocery
store, it may be observed that most of the customers who have
bought item A, have also bought item B and item C or at least
one of them. This means that there is a strong association of
the event �purchase of item A� with the event �purchase of item
B�, or �purchase of item C�. Identifying these sorts of
associations is the goal of association analysis. This helps in
boosting up sales pipeline, hence a critical input for the sales
group. Critical applications of association analysis include
market basket analysis and recommender systems.

1.5.3 Reinforcement learning

We have seen babies learn to walk without any prior
knowledge of how to do it. Often we wonder how they really

do it. They do it in a relatively simple way.

First they notice somebody else walking around, for
example parents or anyone living around. They understand
that legs have to be used, one at a time, to take a step. While
walking, sometimes they fall down hitting an obstacle,
whereas other times they are able to walk smoothly avoiding
bumpy obstacles. When they are able to walk overcoming the
obstacle, their parents are elated and appreciate the baby with
loud claps / or may be a chocolates. When they fall down
while circumventing an obstacle, obviously their parents do
not give claps or chocolates. Slowly a time comes when the
babies learn from mistakes and are able to walk with much
ease.

In the same way, machines often learn to do tasks
autonomously. Let�s try to understand in context of the
example of the child learning to walk. The action tried to be
achieved is walking, the child is the agent and the place with
hurdles on which the child is trying to walk resembles the
environment. It tries to improve its performance of doing the
task. When a sub-task is accomplished successfully, a reward
is given. When a sub-task is not executed correctly, obviously
no reward is given. This continues till the machine is able to
complete execution of the whole task. This process of learning
is known as reinforcement learning. Figure 1.10 captures the
high-level process of reinforcement learning.

FIG. 1.10 Reinforcement learning

One contemporary example of reinforcement learning is
self-driving cars. The critical information which it needs to
take care of are speed and speed limit in different road
segments, traffic conditions, road conditions, weather
conditions, etc. The tasks that have to be taken care of are
start/stop, accelerate/decelerate, turn to left / right, etc.

Further details on reinforcement learning have been kept out

of the scope of this book.

Points to Ponder:

Reinforcement learning is getting more and more attention from both
industry and academia. Annual publications count in the area of
reinforcement learning in Google Scholar support this view.
While Deep Blue used brute force to defeat the human chess champion,
AlphaGo used RL to defeat the best human Go player.
RL is an effective tool for personalized online marketing. It considers
the demographic details and browsing history of the user real-time to
show most relevant advertisements.

1.5.4 Comparison � supervised, unsupervised, and
reinforcement learning

1.6 PROBLES NOT TO BE SOLVED USING MACHINE LEARNING

Machine learning should not be applied to tasks in which
humans are very effective or frequent human intervention is
needed. For example, air traffic control is a very complex task
needing intense human involvement. At the same time, for
very simple tasks which can be implemented using traditional
programming paradigms, there is no sense of using machine
learning. For example, simple rule-driven or formula-based
applications like price calculator engine, dispute tracking
application, etc. do not need machine learning techniques.

Machine learning should be used only when the business

process has some lapses. If the task is already optimized,
incorporating machine learning will not serve to justify the
return on investment.

For situations where training data is not sufficient, machine
learning cannot be used effectively. This is because, with small
training data sets, the impact of bad data is exponentially
worse. For the quality of prediction or recommendation to be
good, the training data should be sizeable.

1.7 APPLICATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING

Wherever there is a substantial amount of past data, machine
learning can be used to generate actionable insight from the
data. Though machine learning is adopted in multiple forms in
every business domain, we have covered below three major
domains just to give some idea about what type of actions can
be done using machine learning.

1.7.1 Banking and finance

In the banking industry, fraudulent transactions, especially the
ones related to credit cards, are extremely prevalent. Since the
volumes as well as velocity of the transactions are extremely

high, high performance machine learning solutions are
implemented by almost all leading banks across the globe. The
models work on a real-time basis, i.e. the fraudulent
transactions are spotted and prevented right at the time of
occurrence. This helps in avoiding a lot of operational hassles
in settling the disputes that customers will otherwise raise
against those fraudulent transactions.

Customers of a bank are often offered lucrative proposals by

other competitor banks. Proposals like higher bank interest,
lower processing charge of loans, zero balance savings
accounts, no overdraft penalty, etc. are offered to customers,
with the intent that the customer switches over to the
competitor bank. Also, sometimes customers get demotivated
by the poor quality of services of the banks and shift to
competitor banks. Machine learning helps in preventing or at
least reducing the customer churn. Both descriptive and
predictive learning can be applied for reducing customer
churn. Using descriptive learning, the specific pockets of
problem, i.e. a specific bank or a specific zone or a specific
type of offering like car loan, may be spotted where maximum
churn is happening. Quite obviously, these are troubled areas
where further investigation needs to be done to find and fix the
root cause. Using predictive learning, the set of vulnerable
customers who may leave the bank very soon, can be
identified. Proper action can be taken to make sure that the
customers stay back.

1.7.2 Insurance

Insurance industry is extremely data intensive. For that reason,
machine learning is extensively used in the insurance industry.
Two major areas in the insurance industry where machine
learning is used are risk prediction during new customer

onboarding and claims management. During customer
onboarding, based on the past information the risk profile of a
new customer needs to be predicted. Based on the quantum of
risk predicted, the quote is generated for the prospective
customer. When a customer claim comes for settlement, past
information related to historic claims along with the adjustor
notes are considered to predict whether there is any possibility
of the claim to be fraudulent. Other than the past information
related to the specific customer, information related to similar
customers, i.e. customer belonging to the same geographical
location, age group, ethnic group, etc., are also considered to
formulate the model.

1.7.3 Healthcare

Wearable device data form a rich source for applying machine
learning and predict the health conditions of the person real
time. In case there is some health issue which is predicted by
the learning model, immediately the person is alerted to take
preventive action. In case of some extreme problem, doctors or
healthcare providers in the vicinity of the person can be
alerted. Suppose an elderly person goes for a morning walk in
a park close to his house. Suddenly, while walking, his blood
pressure shoots up beyond a certain limit, which is tracked by
the wearable. The wearable data is sent to a remote server and
a machine learning algorithm is constantly analyzing the
streaming data. It also has the history of the elderly person and
persons of similar age group. The model predicts some fatality
unless immediate action is taken. Alert can be sent to the
person to immediately stop walking and take rest. Also,
doctors and healthcare providers can be alerted to be on
standby.

Machine learning along with computer vision also plays a

crucial role in disease diagnosis from medical imaging.

1.8 STATE-OF-THE-ART LANGUAGES/TOOLS IN MACHINE LEARNING

The algorithms related to different machine learning tasks are
known to all and can be implemented using any
language/platform. It can be implemented using a Java
platform or C / C++ language or in .NET. However, there are
certain languages and tools which have been developed with a
focus for implementing machine learning. Few of them, which
are most widely used, are covered below.

1.8.1 Python

Python is one of the most popular, open source programming
language widely adopted by machine learning community. It
was designed by Guido van Rossum and was first released in
1991. The reference implementation of Python, i.e. CPython,
is managed by Python Software Foundation, which is a non-
profit organization.

Python has very strong libraries for advanced mathematical

functionalities (NumPy), algorithms and mathematical tools
(SciPy) and numerical plotting (matplotlib). Built on these
libraries, there is a machine learning library named scikit-
learn, which has various classification, regression, and
clustering algorithms embedded in it.

1.8.2 R

R is a language for statistical computing and data analysis. It is
an open source language, extremely popular in the academic
community � especially among statisticians and data miners. R
is considered as a variant of S, a GNU project which was

developed at Bell Laboratories. Currently, it is supported by
the R Foundation for statistical computing.

R is a very simple programming language with a huge set of

libraries available for different stages of machine learning.
Some of the libraries standing out in terms of popularity are
plyr/dplyr (for data transformation), caret (�Classification and
Regression Training� for classification), RJava (to facilitate
integration with Java), tm (for text mining), ggplot2 (for data
visualization). Other than the libraries, certain packages like
Shiny and R Markdown have been developed around R to
develop interactive web applications, documents and
dashboards on R without much effort.

1.8.3 Matlab

MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a licenced commercial
software with a robust support for a wide range of numerical
computing. MATLAB has a huge user base across industry
and academia. MATLAB is developed by MathWorks, a
company founded in 1984. Being proprietary software,
MATLAB is developed much more professionally, tested
rigorously, and has comprehensive documentation.

MATLAB also provides extensive support of statistical

functions and has a huge number of machine learning
algorithms in-built. It also has the ability to scale up for large
datasets by parallel processing on clusters and cloud.

1.8.4 SAS

SAS (earlier known as �Statistical Analysis System�) is
another licenced commercial software which provides strong

support for machine learning functionalities. Developed in C
by SAS Institute, SAS had its first release in the year 1976.

SAS is a software suite comprising different components.
The basic data management functionalities are embedded in
the Base SAS component whereas the other components like
SAS/INSIGHT, Enterprise Miner, SAS/STAT, etc. help in
specialized functions related to data mining and statistical
analysis.

1.8.5 Other languages/tools

There are a host of other languages and tools that also support
machine learning functionalities. Owned by IBM, SPSS
(originally named as Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences) is a popular package supporting specialized data
mining and statistical analysis. Originally popular for
statistical analysis in social science (as the name reflects),
SPSS is now popular in other fields as well.

Released in 2012, Julia is an open source, liberal licence

programming language for numerical analysis and
computational science. It has baked in all good things of
MATLAB, Python, R, and other programming languages used
for machine learning for which it is gaining steady attention
from machine learning development community. Another big
point in favour of Julia is its ability to implement high-
performance machine learning algorithms.

1.9 ISSUES IN MACHINE LEARNING

Machine learning is a field which is relatively new and still
evolving. Also, the level of research and kind of use of
machine learning tools and technologies varies drastically
from country to country. The laws and regulations, cultural

background, emotional maturity of people differ drastically in
different countries. All these factors make the use of machine
learning and the issues originating out of machine learning
usage are quite different.

The biggest fear and issue arising out of machine learning is

related to privacy and the breach of it. The primary focus of
learning is on analyzing data, both past and current, and
coming up with insight from the data. This insight may be
related to people and the facts revealed might be private
enough to be kept confidential. Also, different people have a
different preference when it comes to sharing of information.
While some people may be open to sharing some level of
information publicly, some other people may not want to share
it even to all friends and keep it restricted just to family
members. Classic examples are a birth date (not the day, but
the date as a whole), photographs of a dinner date with family,
educational background, etc. Some people share them with all
in the social platforms like Facebook while others do not, or if
they do, they may restrict it to friends only. When machine
learning algorithms are implemented using those information,
inadvertently people may get upset. For example, if there is a
learning algorithm to do preference-based customer
segmentation and the output of the analysis is used for sending
targeted marketing campaigns, it will hurt the emotion of
people and actually do more harm than good. In certain
countries, such events may result in legal actions to be taken
by the people affected.

Even if there is no breach of privacy, there may be situations

where actions were taken based on machine learning may
create an adverse reaction. Let�s take the example of
knowledge discovery exercise done before starting an election
campaign. If a specific area reveals an ethnic majority or

skewness of a certain demographic factor, and the campaign
pitch carries a message keeping that in mind, it might actually
upset the voters and cause an adverse result.

So a very critical consideration before applying machine
learning is that proper human judgement should be exercised
before using any outcome from machine learning. Only then
the decision taken will be beneficial and also not result in any
adverse impact.

1.10 SUMMARY

Machine learning imbibes the philosophy of human learning, i.e. learning
from expert guidance and from experience.
The basic machine learning process can be divided into three parts.

Data Input: Past data or information is utilized as a basis for future
decision-making.
Abstraction: The input data is represented in a summarized way
Generalization: The abstracted representation is generalized to form a
framework for making decisions.

Before starting to solve any problem using machine learning, it should be
decided whether the problem is a right problem to be solved using machine
learning.
Machine learning can be classified into three broad categories:

Supervised learning: Also called predictive learning. The objective of
this learning is to predict class/value of unknown objects based on
prior information of similar objects. Examples: predicting whether a
tumour is malignant or benign, price prediction in domains such as
real estate, stocks, etc.
Unsupervised learning: Also called descriptive learning, helps in
finding groups or patterns in unknown objects by grouping similar
objects together. Examples: customer segmentation, recommender
systems, etc.
Reinforcement learning: A machine learns to act on its own to achieve
the given goals. Examples: self-driving cars, intelligent robots, etc.
Machine learning has been adopted by various industry domains such as
Banking and Financial Services, Insurance, Healthcare, Life Sciences, etc. to
solve problems.
Some of the most adopted platforms to implement machine learning include
Python, R, MATLAB, SAS, SPPSS, etc.
To avoid ethical issues, the critical consideration is required before applying
machine learning and using any outcome from machine learning.

Preparing to Model

OBJECTIVE OF THE CHAPTER:

This chapter gives a detailed view of how to understand
the incoming data and create basic understanding about the
nature and quality of the data. This information, in turn,
helps to select and then how to apply the model. So, the
knowledge imparted in this chapter helps a beginner take
the first step towards effective modelling and solving a
machine learning problem.

2.1 INTRODUCTION

In the last chapter, we got introduced to machine learning. In
the beginning, we got a glimpse of the journey of machine
learning as an evolving technology. It all started as a
proposition from the renowned computer scientist Alan Turing
� machines can �learn� and become artificially intelligent.
Gradually, through the next few decades path-breaking
innovations came in from Arthur Samuel, Frank Rosenblatt,
John Hopfield, Christopher Watkins, Geoffrey Hinton and
many other computer scientists. They shaped up concepts of

Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Network, Reinforcement
Learning, Deep Learning, etc. which took machine learning to
new heights. In parallel, interesting applications of machine
learning kept on happening, with organizations like IBM and
Google taking a lead. What started with IBM�s Deep Blue
beating the world chess champion Gary Kasparov, continued
with IBM�s Watson beating two human champions in a
Jeopardy competition.Google also started with a series of
innovations applying machine learning. The Google Brain,
Sibyl, Waymo, AlphaGo programs � are all extremely
advanced applications of machine learning which have taken
the technology a few notches up. Now we can see an all-
pervasive presence of machine learning technology in all
walks of life.

We have also seen the types of human learning and how
that, in some ways, can be related to the types of machine
learning � supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement.
Supervised learning, as we saw, implies learning from past
data, also called training data, which has got known values or
classes. Machines can �learn� or get �trained� from the past
data and assign classes or values to unknown data, termed as
test data. This helps in solving problems related to prediction.
This is much like human learning through expert guidance as
happens for infants from parents or students through teachers.
So, supervised learning in case of machines can be perceived
as guided learning from human inputs. Unsupervised machine
learning doesn�t have labelled data to learn from. It tries to
find patterns in unlabelled data. This is much like human
beings trying to group together objects of similar shape. This
learning is not guided by labelled inputs but uses the
knowledge gained from the labels themselves. Last but not the
least is reinforcement learning in which machine tries to learn

by itself through penalty/ reward mechanism � again pretty
much in the same way as human self-learning happens.

Lastly, we saw some of the applications of machine learning

in different domains such as banking and finance, insurance,
and healthcare. Fraud detection is a critical business case
which is implemented in almost all banks across the world and
uses machine learning predominantly. Risk prediction for new
customers is a similar critical case in the insurance industry
which finds the application of machine learning. In the
healthcare sector, disease prediction makes wide use of
machine learning, especially in the developed countries.

While development in machine learning technology has

been extensive and its implementation has become
widespread, to start as a practitioner, we need to gain some
basic understanding. We need to understand how to apply the
array of tools and technologies available in the machine
learning to solve a problem. In fact, that is going to be very
specific to the kind of problem that we are trying to solve. If it
is a prediction problem, the kind of activities that will be
involved is going to be completely different vis-�-vis if it is a
problem where we are trying to unfold a pattern in a data
without any past knowledge about the data. So how a machine
learning project looks like or what are the salient activities that
form the core of a machine learning project will depend on
whether it is in the area of supervised or unsupervised or
reinforcement learning area. However, irrespective of the
variation, some foundational knowledge needs to be built
before we start with the core machine learning concepts and
key algorithms. In this section, we will have a quick look at a
few typical machine learning activities and focus on some of
the foundational concepts that all practitioners need to gain as

pre-requisites before starting their journey in the area of
machine learning.

Points to Ponder

No man is perfect. The same is applicable for machines. To
increase the level of accuracy of a machine, human
participation should be added to the machine learning
process. In short, incorporating human intervention is the
recipe for the success of machine learning.

2.2 MACHINE LEARNING ACTIVITIES

The first step in machine learning activity starts with data. In
case of supervised learning, it is the labelled training data set
followed by test data which is not labelled. In case of
unsupervised learning, there is no question of labelled data but
the task is to find patterns in the input data. A thorough review
and exploration of the data is needed to understand the type of
the data, the quality of the data and relationship between the
different data elements. Based on that, multiple pre-processing
activities may need to be done on the input data before we can
go ahead with core machine learning activities. Following are
the typical preparation activities done once the input data
comes into the machine learning system:

Understand the type of data in the given input data set.
Explore the data to understand the nature and quality.
Explore the relationships amongst the data elements, e.g. inter-feature
relationship.
Find potential issues in data.

Do the necessary remediation, e.g. impute missing data values, etc., if
needed.
Apply pre-processing steps, as necessary.
Once the data is prepared for modelling, then the learning tasks start off. As
a part of it, do the following activities:

The input data is first divided into parts � the training data and the test
data (called holdout). This step is applicable for supervised learning
only.
Consider different models or learning algorithms for selection.
Train the model based on the training data for supervised learning
problem and apply to unknown data. Directly apply the chosen
unsupervised model on the input data for unsupervised learning
problem.

After the model is selected, trained (for supervised

learning), and applied on input data, the performance of the
model is evaluated. Based on options available, specific
actions can be taken to improve the performance of the model,
if possible.

model. The remaining parts, i.e. learning, performance
evaluation, and performance improvement will be covered in
Chapter 3.

2.3 BASIC TYPES OF DATA IN MACHINE LEARNING

Before starting with types of data, let�s first understand what a
data set is and what are the elements of a data set. A data set is
a collection of related information or records. The information

may be on some entity or some subject area. For example (Fig.
2.2), we may have a data set on students in which each record
consists of information about a specific student. Again, we can
have a data set on student performance which has records
providing performance, i.e. marks on the individual subjects.

Each row of a data set is called a record. Each data set also
has multiple attributes, each of which gives information on a
specific characteristic. For example, in the data set on students,
there are four attributes namely Roll Number, Name, Gender,
and Age, each of which understandably is a specific
characteristic about the student entity. Attributes can also be
termed as feature, variable, dimension or field. Both the data
sets, Student and Student Performance, are having four
features or dimensions; hence they are told to have four-
dimensional data space. A row or record represents a point in
the four-dimensional data space as each row has specific
values for each of the four attributes or features. Value of an
attribute, quite understandably, may vary from record to
record. For example, if we refer to the first two records in the
Student data set, the value of attributes Name, Gender, and
Age are different (Fig. 2.3).

FIG. 2.2 Examples of data set

FIG. 2.3 Data set records and attributes

Now that a context of data sets is given, let�s try to

understand the different types of data that we generally come
across in machine learning problems. Data can broadly be
divided into following two types:

1. Qualitative data
2. Quantitative data

Qualitative data provides information about the quality of

an object or information which cannot be measured. For

example, if we consider the quality of performance of students
in terms of �Good�, �Average�, and �Poor�, it falls under the
category of qualitative data. Also, name or roll number of
students are information that cannot be measured using some
scale of measurement. So they would fall under qualitative
data. Qualitative data is also called categorical data.
Qualitative data can be further subdivided into two types as
follows:

1. Nominal data
2. Ordinal data

Nominal data is one which has no numeric value, but a

named value. It is used for assigning named values to
attributes. Nominal values cannot be quantified. Examples of
nominal data are

1. Blood group: A, B, O, AB, etc.
2. Nationality: Indian, American, British, etc.
3. Gender: Male, Female, Other

Note:

A special case of nominal data is when only two labels are
possible, e.g. pass/fail as a result of an examination. This
sub-type of nominal data is called �dichotomous�.

It is obvious, mathematical operations such as addition,

subtraction, multiplication, etc. cannot be performed on
nominal data. For that reason, statistical functions such as
mean, variance, etc. can also not be applied on nominal data.

However, a basic count is possible. So mode, i.e. most
frequently occurring value, can be identified for nominal data.

Ordinal data, in addition to possessing the properties of

nominal data, can also be naturally ordered. This means
ordinal data also assigns named values to attributes but unlike
nominal data, they can be arranged in a sequence of increasing
or decreasing value so that we can say whether a value is
better than or greater than another value. Examples of ordinal
data are

1. Customer satisfaction: �Very Happy�, �Happy�, �Unhappy�, etc.
2. Grades: A, B, C, etc.
3. Hardness of Metal: �Very Hard�, �Hard�, �Soft�, etc.

Like nominal data, basic counting is possible for ordinal
data. Hence, the mode can be identified. Since ordering is
possible in case of ordinal data, median, and quartiles can be
identified in addition. Mean can still not be calculated.

Quantitative data relates to information about the quantity

of an object � hence it can be measured. For example, if we
consider the attribute �marks�, it can be measured using a scale
of measurement. Quantitative data is also termed as numeric
data. There are two types of quantitative data:

1. Interval data
2. Ratio data

Interval data is numeric data for which not only the order

is known, but the exact difference between values is also
known. An ideal example of interval data is Celsius
temperature. The difference between each value remains the
same in Celsius temperature. For example, the difference
between 12�C and 18�C degrees is measurable and is 6�C as in

the case of difference between 15.5�C and 21.5�C. Other
examples include date, time, etc.

For interval data, mathematical operations such as addition
and subtraction are possible. For that reason, for interval data,
the central tendency can be measured by mean, median, or
mode. Standard deviation can also be calculated.

However, interval data do not have something called a �true

zero� value. For example, there is nothing called �0
temperature� or �no temperature�. Hence, only addition and
subtraction applies for interval data. The ratio cannot be
applied. This means, we can say a temperature of 40�C is
equal to the temperature of 20�C + temperature of 20�C.
However, we cannot say the temperature of 40�C means it is
twice as hot as in temperature of 20�C.

Ratio data represents numeric data for which exact value

can be measured. Absolute zero is available for ratio data.
Also, these variables can be added, subtracted, multiplied, or
divided. The central tendency can be measured by mean,
median, or mode and methods of dispersion such as standard
deviation. Examples of ratio data include height, weight, age,
salary, etc.

Figure 2.4 gives a summarized view of different types of
data that we may find in a typical machine learning problem.

FIG. 2.4 Types of data

Apart from the approach detailed above, attributes can also
be categorized into types based on a number of values that can
be assigned. The attributes can be either discrete or continuous
based on this factor.

Discrete attributes can assume a finite or countably infinite

number of values. Nominal attributes such as roll number,
street number, pin code, etc. can have a finite number of
values whereas numeric attributes such as count, rank of
students, etc. can have countably infinite values. A special
type of discrete attribute which can assume two values only is
called binary attribute. Examples of binary attribute include
male/ female, positive/negative, yes/no, etc.

Continuous attributes can assume any possible value which

is a real number. Examples of continuous attribute include
length, height, weight, price, etc.

Note:

In general, nominal and ordinal attributes are discrete. On
the other hand, interval and ratio attributes are continuous,

barring a few exceptions, e.g. �count� attribute.

2.4 EXPLORING STRUCTURE OF DATA

By now, we understand that in machine learning, we come
across two basic data types � numeric and categorical. With
this context in mind, we can delve deeper into understanding a
data set. We need to understand that in a data set, which of the
attributes are numeric and which are categorical in nature. This
is because, the approach of exploring numeric data is different
than the approach of exploring categorical data. In case of a
standard data set, we may have the data dictionary available
for reference. Data dictionary is a metadata repository, i.e. the
repository of all information related to the structure of each
data element contained in the data set. The data dictionary
gives detailed information on each of the attributes � the
description as well as the data type and other relevant details.
In case the data dictionary is not available, we need to use
standard library function of the machine learning tool that we
are using and get the details. For the time being, let us move
ahead with a standard data set from UCI machine learning
repository.

Did you know?

University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning
Repository (http:// archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) is a
collection of 400+ data sets which serve as benchmarks for
researchers and practitioners in the machine learning
community.

The data set that we take as a reference is the Auto MPG

data set available in the UCI repository. Figure 2.5 is a
snapshot of the first few rows of the data set.

FIG. 2.5 Auto MPG data set

As is quite evident from the data, the attributes such as
�mpg�, �cylinders�, �displacement�, �horsepower�, �weight�,
�acceleration�, �model year�, and �origin� are all numeric. Out
of these attributes, �cylinders�, �model year�, and �origin� are

discrete in nature as the only finite number of values can be
assumed by these attributes. The remaining of the numeric
attributes, i.e. �mpg�, �displacement�, �horsepower�, �weight�,
and �acceleration� can assume any real value.

Note:

Since the attributes �cylinders� or �origin� have a small
number of possible values, one may prefer to treat it as a
categorical or qualitative attribute and explore in that way.
Anyways, we will treat these attributes as numeric or
quantitative as we are trying to show data exploration and
related nuances in this section.

Hence, these attributes are continuous in nature. The only
remaining attribute �car name� is of type categorical, or more
specifically nominal. This data set is regarding prediction of
fuel consumption in miles per gallon, i.e. the numeric attribute
�mpg� is the target attribute.

With this understanding of the data set attributes, we can

start exploring the numeric and categorical attributes
separately.

2.4.1 Exploring numerical data

There are two most effective mathematical plots to explore
numerical data � box plot and histogram. We will explore all
these plots one by one, starting with the most critical one,
which is the box plot.

2.4.1.1 Understanding central tendency

To understand the nature of numeric variables, we can apply
the measures of central tendency of data, i.e. mean and
median. In statistics, measures of central tendency help us
understand the central point of a set of data. Mean, by
definition, is a sum of all data values divided by the count of
data elements. For example, mean of a set of observations �
21, 89, 34, 67, and 96 is calculated as below.

If the above set of numbers represents marks of 5 students
in a class, the mean marks, or the falling in the middle of the
range is 61.4.

Median, on contrary, is the value of the element appearing

in the middle of an ordered list of data elements. If we
consider the above 5 data elements, the ordered list would be �
21, 34, 67, 89, and 96. Since there are 5 data elements, the 3rd
element in the ordered list is considered as the median. Hence,
the median value of this set of data is 67.

There might be a natural curiosity to understand why two
measures of central tendency are reviewed. The reason is mean
and median are impacted differently by data values appearing
at the beginning or at the end of the range. Mean being
calculated from the cumulative sum of data values, is impacted
if too many data elements are having values closer to the far
end of the range, i.e. close to the maximum or minimum
values. It is especially sensitive to outliers, i.e. the values
which are unusually high or low, compared to the other values.
Mean is likely to get shifted drastically even due to the

presence of a small number of outliers. If we observe that for
certain attributes the deviation between values of mean and
median are quite high, we should investigate those attributes
further and try to find out the root cause along with the need
for remediation.

So, in the context of the Auto MPG data set, let�s try to find

out for each of the numeric attributes the values of mean and
median. We can also find out if the deviation between these
values is large. In Figure 2.6, the comparison between mean
and median for all the attributes has been shown. We can see
that for the attributes such as �mpg�, �weight�, �acceleration�,
and �model.year� the deviation between mean and median is
not significant which means the chance of these attributes
having too many outlier values is less. However, the deviation
is significant for the attributes �cylinders�, �displacement� and
�origin�. So, we need to further drill down and look at some
more statistics for these attributes. Also, there is some problem
in the values of the attribute �horsepower� because of which
the mean and median calculation is not possible.

FIG. 2.6 Mean vs. Median for Auto MPG

With a bit of investigation, we can find out that the problem
is occurring because of the 6 data elements, as shown in Figure
2.7, do not have value for the attribute �horsepower�.

FIG. 2.7 Missing values of attribute �horsepower� in Auto MPG

For that reason, the attribute �horsepower� is not treated as a

numeric. That�s why the operations applicable on numeric
variables, like mean or median, are failing. So we have to first
remediate the missing values of the attribute �horsepower�
before being able to do any kind of exploration. However, we
will cover the approach of remediation of missing values a
little later.

2.4.1.2 Understanding data spread

Now that we have explored the central tendency of the
different numeric attributes, we have a clear idea of which
attributes have a large deviation between mean and median.
Let�s look closely at those attributes. To drill down more, we
need to look at the entire range of values of the attributes,
though not at the level of data elements as that may be too vast
to review manually. So we will take a granular view of the
data spread in the form of

1. Dispersion of data
2. Position of the different data values

2.4.1.2.1 Measuring data dispersion

Consider the data values of two attributes

1. Attribute 1 values : 44, 46, 48, 45, and 47
2. Attribute 2 values : 34, 46, 59, 39, and 52

Both the set of values have a mean and median of 46.
However, the first set of values that is of attribute 1 is more
concentrated or clustered around the mean/median value
whereas the second set of values of attribute 2 is quite spread
out or dispersed. To measure the extent of dispersion of a data,
or to find out how much the different values of a data are
spread out, the variance of the data is measured. The variance
of a data is measured using the formula given below:

Variance

, where x is the variable or

attribute whose variance is to be measured and n is the number
of observations or values of variable x.

Standard deviation of a data is measured as follows:

Larger value of variance or standard deviation indicates

more dispersion in the data and vice versa. In the above
example, let�s calculate the variance of attribute 1 and that of
attribute 2. For attribute 1,

For attribute 2,

So it is quite clear from the measure that attribute 1 values

are quite concentrated around the mean while attribute 2
values are extremely spread out. Since this data was small, a
visual inspection and understanding were possible and that
matches with the measured value.

2.4.1.2.2 Measuring data value position

When the data values of an attribute are arranged in an
increasing order, we have seen earlier that median gives the
central data value, which divides the entire data set into two
halves. Similarly, if the first half of the data is divided into two
halves so that each half consists of one-quarter of the data set,

1

then that median of the first half is known as first quartile or
Q . In the same way, if the second half of the data is divided
into two halves, then that median of the second half is known
as third quartile or Q . The overall median is also known as
second quartile or Q . So, any data set has five values -
minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3),
and maximum.

3

2

Let�s review these values for the attributes �cylinders�,

�displacement�, and �origin�. Figure 2.8 captures a summary of
the range of statistics for the attributes. If we take the example
of the attribute �displacement�, we can see that the difference
between minimum value and Q1 is 36.2 and the difference
between Q1 and median is 44.3. On the contrary, the
difference between median and Q3 is 113.5 and Q3 and the
maximum value is 193. In other words, the larger values are
more spread out than the smaller ones. This helps in
understanding why the value of mean is much higher than that
of the median for the attribute �displacement�. Similarly, in
case of attribute �cylinders�, we can observe that the difference
between minimum value and median is 1 whereas the
difference between median and the maximum value is 4. For
the attribute �origin�, the difference between minimum value
and median is 0 whereas the difference between median and
the maximum value is 2.

FIG. 2.8 Attribute value drill-down for Auto MPG

Note:

Quantiles refer to specific points in a data set which divide
the data set into equal parts or equally sized quantities.
There are specific variants of quantile, the one dividing
data set into four parts being termed as quartile. Another
such popular variant is percentile, which divides the data
set into 100 parts.

However, we still cannot ascertain whether there is any
outlier present in the data. For that, we can better adopt some
means to visualize the data. Box plot is an excellent
visualization medium for numeric data.

2.4.2 Plotting and exploring numerical data

2.4.2.1 Box plots

Now that we have a fairly clear understanding of the data set
attributes in terms of spread and central tendency, let�s try to
make an attempt to visualize the whole thing as a box-plot. A
box plot is an extremely effective mechanism to get a one-shot
view and understand the nature of the data. But before we get
to review the box plot for different attributes of Auto MPG
data set, let�s first try to understand a box plot in general and
the interpretation of different aspects in a box plot. As we can
see in Figure 2.9, the box plot (also called box and whisker
plot) gives a standard visualization of the five-number
summary statistics of a data, namely minimum, first quartile
(Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum. Below
is a detailed interpretation of a box plot.

The central rectangle or the box spans from first to third quartile (i.e. Q1 to
Q3), thus giving the inter-quartile range (IQR).
Median is given by the line or band within the box.
The lower whisker extends up to 1.5 times of the inter-quartile range (or
IQR) from the bottom of the box, i.e. the first quartile or Q1. However, the
actual length of the lower whisker depends on the lowest data value that falls
within (Q1 ? 1.5 times of IQR). Let�s try to understand this with an example.
Say for a specific set of data, Q1 = 73, median = 76 and Q3 = 79. Hence,
IQR will be 6 (i.e. Q3 � Q1).So, lower whisker can extend maximum till (Q1
� 1.5 � IQR) = 73 � 1.5 � 6 = 64. However, say there are lower range data
values such as 70, 63, and 60. So, the lower whisker will come at 70 as this
is the lowest data value larger than 64.
The upper whisker extends up to 1.5 as times of the inter-quartile range (or
IQR) from the top of the box, i.e. the third quartile or Q3. Similar to lower
whisker, the actual length of the upper whisker will also depend on the
highest data value that falls within (Q3 + 1.5 times of IQR). Let�s try to
understand this with an example. For the same set of data mentioned in the
above point, upper whisker can extend maximum till (Q3 + 1.5 � IQR) = 79
+ 1.5 � 6 = 88. If there is higher range of data values like 82, 84, and 89. So,
the upper whisker will come at 84 as this is the highest data value lower than
88.
The data values coming beyond the lower or upper whiskers are the ones
which are of unusually low or high values respectively. These are the
outliers, which may deserve special consideration.

FIG. 2.9 Box plot

Note:

There are different variants of box plots. The one covered
above is the Tukey box plot. Famous mathematician John
W. Tukey introduced this type of box plot in 1969.

Let�s visualize the box plot for the three attributes -

�cylinders�, �displacement�, and �origin�. We will also review
the box plot of another attribute in which the deviation
between mean and median is very little and see what the basic

difference in the respective box plots is. Figure 2.10 presents
the respective box plots.

FIG. 2.10 Box plot of Auto MPG attributes

2.4.2.1.1 Analysing box plot for �cylinders�

The box plot for attribute �cylinders� looks pretty weird in
shape. The upper whisker is missing, the band for median falls
at the bottom of the box, even the lower whisker is pretty
small compared to the length of the box! Is everything right?

The answer is a big YES, and you can figure it out if you
delve a little deeper into the actual data values of the attribute.
The attribute �cylinders� is discrete in nature having values
from 3 to 8. Table 2.2 captures the frequency and cumulative
frequency of it.

Table 2.2 Frequency of �Cylinders� Attribute

As can be observed in the table, the frequency is extremely

high for data value 4. Two other data values where the
frequency is quite high are 6 and 8. So now if we try to find
the quartiles, since the total frequency is 398, the first quartile
(Q1), median (Q2), and third quartile (Q3) will be at a
cumulative frequency 99.5 (i.e. average of 99th and 100th
observation), 199 and 298.5 (i.e. average of 298th and 299th
observation), respectively. This way Q1 = 4, median = 4 and
Q3 = 8. Since there is no data value beyond 8, there is no
upper whisker. Also, since both Q1 and median are 4, the band
for median falls on the bottom of the box. Same way, though
the lower whisker could have extended till -2 (Q1 � 1.5 � IQR
= 4 � 1.5 � 4 = �2), in reality, there is no data value lower than
3. Hence, the lower whisker is also short. In any case, a value
of cylinders less than 1 is not possible.

2.4.2.1.2 Analysing box plot for �origin�

Like the box plot for attribute �cylinders�, the box plot for
attribute �cylinders� also looks pretty weird in shape. Here the
lower whisker is missing and the band for median falls at the
bottom of the box! Let�s verify if everything right?

Just like the attribute �cylinders�, attribute �origin� is

discrete in nature having values from 1 to 3. Table 2.3 captures

the frequency and cumulative frequency (i.e. a summation of
frequencies of all previous intervals) of it.

Table 2.3 Frequency of �Origin� Attribute

As can be observed in the table, the frequency is extremely
high for data value 1. Since the total frequency is 398, the first
quartile (Q1), median (Q2), and third quartile (Q3) will be at a
cumulative frequency 99.5 (i.e. average of 99th and 100th
observation), 199 and 298.5 (i.e. average of 298th and 299th
observation), respectively. This way Q1 = 1, median = 1, and
Q3 = 2. Since Q1 and median are same in value, the band for
median falls on the bottom of the box. There is no data value
lower than Q1. Hence, the lower whisker is missing.

2.4.2.1.3 Analysing box plot for �displacement�

The box plot for the attribute �displacement� looks better than
the previous box plots. However, still, there are few small
abnormalities, the cause of which needs to be reviewed.
Firstly, the lower whisker is much smaller than an upper
whisker. Also, the band for median is closer to the bottom of
the box.

Let�s take a closer look at the summary data of the attribute
�displacement�. The value of first quartile, Q1 = 104.2, median
= 148.5, and third quartile, Q3 = 262. Since (median � Q1) =

44.3 is greater than (Q3 � median) = 113.5, the band for the
median is closer to the bottom of the box (which represents
Q1). The value of IQR, in this case, is 157.8. So the lower
whisker can be 1.5 times 157.8 less than Q1. But minimum
data value for the attribute �displacement� is 68. So, the lower
whisker at 15% [(Q1 � minimum)/1.5 � IQR = (104.2 � 68) /
(1.5 � 157.8) = 15%] of the permissible length. On the other
hand, the maximum data value is 455. So the upper whisker is
81% [(maximum � Q3)/1.5 � IQR = (455 � 262) / (1.5 �
157.8) = 81%] of the permissible length. This is why the upper
whisker is much longer than the lower whisker.

2.4.2.1.4 Analysing box plot for �model Year�

The box plot for the attribute �model. year� looks perfect. Let�s
validate is it really what expected to be.

For the attribute �model.year�:

   First quartile, Q1 = 73

   Median, Q2 = 76

   Third quartile, Q3 = 79

So, the difference between median and Q1 is exactly equal

to Q3 and median (both are 3). That is why the band for the
median is exactly equidistant from the bottom and top of the
box.

I QR = Q3 9 Q1 = 7 9 - 7 3 = 6

Difference between Q1 and minimum data value (i.e. 70) is
also same as maximum data value (i.e. 82) and Q3 (both are
3). So both lower and upper whiskers are expected to be of the
same size which is 33% [3 / (1.5 � 6)] of the permissible
length.

2.4.2.2 Histogram

Histogram is another plot which helps in effective
visualization of numeric attributes. It helps in understanding
the distribution of a numeric data into series of intervals, also
termed as �bins�. The important difference between histogram
and box plot is

The focus of histogram is to plot ranges of data values (acting as �bins�), the
number of data elements in each range will depend on the data distribution.
Based on that, the size of each bar corresponding to the different ranges
will vary.
The focus of box plot is to divide the data elements in a data set into four
equal  portions, such that each portion contains an equal number of data
elements.

Histograms might be of different shapes depending on the

nature of the data, e.g. skewness. Figure 2.11 provides a
depiction of different shapes of the histogram that are
generally created. These patterns give us a quick
understanding of the data and thus act as a great data
exploration tool.

FIG. 2.11 General Histogram shapes

Let�s now examine the histograms for the different attributes

of Auto MPG data set presented in Figure 2.12. The
histograms for �mpg� and �weight� are right-skewed. The
histogram for �acceleration� is symmetric and unimodal,
whereas the one for �model.year� is symmetric and uniform.
For the remaining attributes, histograms are multimodal in
nature.

Now let�s dig deep into one of the histograms, say the one
for the attribute �acceleration�. The histogram is composed of a
number of bars, one bar appearing for each of the �bins�. The
height of the bar reflects the total count of data elements
whose value falls within the specific bin value, or the
frequency. Talking in context of the histogram for acceleration,
each �bin� represents an acceleration value interval of 2 units.
So the second bin, e.g., reflects acceleration value of 10 to 12
units. The corresponding bar chart height reflects the count of

all data elements whose value lies between 10 and 12 units.
Also, it is evident from the histogram that it spans over the
acceleration value of 8 to 26 units. The frequency of data
elements corresponding to the bins first keep on increasing, till
it reaches the bin of range 14 to 16 units. At this range, the bar
is tallest in size. So we can conclude that a maximum number
of data elements fall within this range. After this range, the bar
size starts decreasing till the end of the whole range at the
acceleration value of 26 units.

Please note that when the histogram is uniform, as in the
case of attribute �model. year�, it gives a hint that all values are
equally likely to occur.

2.4.3 Exploring categorical data

We have seen there are multiple ways to explore numeric data.
However, there are not many options for exploring categorical
data. In the Auto MPG data set, attribute �car.name� is
categorical in nature. Also, as we discussed earlier, we may
consider �cylinders� as a categorical variable instead of a
numeric variable.

The first summary which we may be interested in noting is
how many unique names are there for the attribute �car name�

or how many unique values are there for �cylinders� attribute.
We can get this as follows:

For attribute �car name�

1. Chevrolet chevelle malibu
2. Buick skylark 320
3. Plymouth satellite
4. Amc rebel sst
5. Ford torino
6. Ford galaxie 500
7. Chevrolet impala
8. Plymouth fury iii
9. Pontiac catalina

10. Amc ambassador dpl

For attribute �cylinders�

8 4 6 3 5

We may also look for a little more details and want to get a
table consisting the categories of the attribute and count of the
data elements falling into that category. Tables 2.4 and 2.5
contain these details.

For attribute �car name�

Table 2.4 Count of Categories for �car name� Attribute

For attribute �cylinders�

Table 2.5 Count of Categories for �Cylinders� Attribute

In the same way, we may also be interested to know the
proportion (or percentage) of count of data elements belonging
to a category. Say, e.g., for the attributes �cylinders�, the
proportion of data elements belonging to the category 4 is 204
� 398 = 0.513, i.e. 51.3%. Tables 2.6 and 2.7 contain the
summarization of the categorical attributes by proportion of
data elements.

For attribute �car name�

Table 2.6 Proportion of Categories for ��Cylinders� Attribute

For attribute �cylinders�

Table 2.7 Proportion of Categories for �Cylinders� Attribute

Last but not the least, as we have read in the earlier section
on types of data, statistical measure �mode� is applicable on
categorical attributes. As we know, like mean and median,
mode is also a statistical measure for central tendency of a
data. Mode of a data is the data value which appears most
often. In context of categorical attribute, it is the category
which has highest number of data values. Since mean and
median cannot be applied for categorical variables, mode is the
sole measure of central tendency.

Let�s try to find out the mode for the attributes �car name�
and �cylinders�. For cylinders, since the number of categories
is less and we have the entire table listed above, we can see
that the mode is 4, as that is the data value for which frequency
is highest. More than 50% of data elements belong to the
category 4. However, it is not so evident for the attribute �car
name� from the information given above. When we probe and
try to find the mode, it is found to be category �ford pinto� for
which frequency is of highest value 6.

An attribute may have one or more modes. Frequency
distribution of an attribute having single mode is called
�unimodal�, two modes are called �bimodal� and multiple
modes are called �multimodal�.

2.4.4 Exploring relationship between variables

Till now we have been exploring single attributes in isolation.
One more important angle of data exploration is to explore
relationship between attributes. There are multiple plots to
enable us explore the relationship between variables. The basic
and most commonly used plot is scatter plot.

2.4.4.1 Scatter plot

A scatter plot helps in visualizing bivariate relationships, i.e.
relationship between two variables. It is a two-dimensional
plot in which points or dots are drawn on coordinates provided
by values of the attributes. For example, in a data set there are
two attributes � attr_1 and attr_2. We want to understand the
relationship between two attributes, i.e. with a change in value
of one attribute, say attr_1, how does the value of the other
attribute, say attr_2, changes. We can draw a scatter plot, with
attr_1 mapped to x-axis and attr_2 mapped in y-axis. So, every
point in the plot will have value of attr_1 in the x-coordinate
and value of attr_2 in the y-coordinate. As in a two-
dimensional plot, attr_1 is said to be the independent variable
and attr_2 as the dependent variable.

Let�s take a real example in this context. In the data set Auto

MPG, there is expected to be some relation between the
attributes �displacement� and �mpg�. Let�s try to verify our
intuition using the scatter plot of �displacement� and �mpg�.
Let�s map �displacement� as the x-coordinate and �mpg� as the
y-coordinate. The scatter plot comes as in Figure 2.13.

As is evident in the scatter plot, there is a definite relation

between the two variables. The value of �mpg� seems to
steadily decrease with the increase in the value of
�displacement�. It may come in our mind that what is the
extent of relationship? Well, it can be reviewed by calculating

the correlation between the variables. Refer to chapter 5 if you
want to find more about correlation and how to calculate it.
One more interesting fact to notice is that there are certain data
values which stand-out of the others. For example, there is one
data element which has a mpg of 37 for a displacement of 250.
This record is completely different from other data elements
having similar displacement value but mpg value in the range
of 15 to 25. This gives an indication that of presence of outlier
data values.

FIG. 2.13 Scatter plot of �displacement� and �mpg�

In Figure 2.14, the pair wise relationship among the features

� �mpg�, �displacement�, �horsepower�, �weight�, and
�acceleration� have been captured. As you can see, in most of
the cases, there is a significant relationship between the
attribute pairs. However, in some cases, e.g. between attributes
�weight� and �acceleration�, the relationship doesn�t seem to be
very strong.

FIG. 2.14 Pair wise scatter plot between different attributes of Auto MPG

2.4.4.2 Two-way cross-tabulations

Two-way cross-tabulations (also called cross-tab or
contingency table) are used to understand the relationship of
two categorical attributes in a concise way. It has a matrix
format that presents a summarized view of the bivariate
frequency distribution. A cross-tab, very much like a scatter
plot, helps to understand how much the data values of one
attribute changes with the change in data values of another

attribute. Let�s try to see with examples, in context of the Auto
MPG data set.

Let�s assume the attributes �cylinders�, �model.year�, and
�origin� as categorical and try to examine the variation of one
with respect to the other. As we understand, attribute
�cylinders� reflects the number of cylinders in a car and
assumes values 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8. Attribute �model.year�
captures the model year of each of the car and �origin� gives
the region of the car, the values for origin 1, 2, and 3
corresponding to North America, Europe, and Asia. Below are
the cross-tabs. Let�s try to understand what information they
actually provide.

The first cross-tab, i.e. the one showing relationship

between attributes �model. year� and �origin� help us
understand the number of vehicles per year in each of the
regions North America, Europe, and Asia. Looking at it in
another way, we can get the count of vehicles per region over
the different years. All these are in the context of the sample
data given in the Auto MPG data set.

Moving to the second cross-tab, it gives the number of 3, 4,

5, 6, or 8 cylinder cars in every region present in the sample
data set. The last cross-tab presents the number of 3, 4, 5, 6, or
8 cylinder cars every year.

We may also want to create cross-tabs with a more

summarized view like have a cross-tab giving a number of cars
having 4 or less cylinders and more than 4 cylinders in each
region or by the years. This can be done by rolling up data
values by the attribute �cylinder�. Tables 2.8�2.10 present
cross-tabs for different attribute combinations.

2.5 DATA QUALITY AND REMEDIATION

2.5.1 Data quality

Success of machine learning depends largely on the quality of
data. A data which has the right quality helps to achieve better
prediction accuracy, in case of supervised learning. However,
it is not realistic to expect that the data will be flawless. We
have already come across at least two types of problems:

1. Certain data elements without a value or data with a missing value.
2. Data elements having value surprisingly different from the other

elements, which we term as outliers.

There are multiple factors which lead to these data quality

issues. Following are some of them:

Incorrect sample set selection: The data may not reflect normal or regular
quality due to incorrect selection of sample set. For example, if we are
selecting a sample set of sales transactions from a festive period and trying to
use that data to predict sales in future. In this case, the prediction will be far
apart from the actual scenario, just because the sample set has been selected
in a wrong time. Similarly, if we are trying to predict poll results using a
training data which doesn�t comprise of a right mix of voters from different
segments such as age, sex, ethnic diversities, etc., the prediction is bound to
be a failure. It may also happen due to incorrect sample size. For example, a
sample of small size may not be able to capture all aspects or information
needed for right learning of the model.

Errors in data collection: resulting in outliers and missing values

In many cases, a person or group of persons are responsible for the
collection of data to be used in a learning activity. In this manual
process, there is the possibility of wrongly recording data either in
terms of value (say 20.67 is wrongly recorded as 206.7 or 2.067) or in
terms of a unit of measurement (say cm. is wrongly recorded as m. or
mm.). This may result in data elements which have abnormally high
or low value from other elements. Such records are termed as outliers.
It may also happen that the data is not recorded at all. In case of a
survey conducted to collect data, it is all the more possible as survey
responders may choose not to respond to a certain question. So the
data value for that data element in that responder�s record is missing.

2.5.2 Data remediation

The issues in data quality, as mentioned above, need to be
remediated, if the right amount of efficiency has to be
achieved in the learning activity. Out of the two major areas
mentioned above, the first one can be remedied by proper
sampling technique. This is a completely different area �
covered as a specialized subject area in statistics. We will not
cover that in this book. However, human errors are bound to
happen, no matter whatever checks and balances we put in.
Hence, proper remedial steps need to be taken for the second
area mentioned above. We will discuss how to handle outliers
and missing values.

2.5.2.1 Handling outliers

Outliers are data elements with an abnormally high value
which may impact prediction accuracy, especially in
regression models. Once the outliers are identified and the
decision has been taken to amend those values, you may
consider one of the following approaches. However, if the
outliers are natural, i.e. the value of the data element is
surprisingly high or low because of a valid reason, then we
should not amend it.

Remove outliers: If the number of records which are outliers is not many, a
simple approach may be to remove them.
Imputation: One other way is to impute the value with mean or median or
mode. The value of the most similar data element may also be used for
imputation.
Capping: For values that lie outside the 1.5|�| IQR limits, we can cap them
by replacing those observations below the lower limit with the value of 5th
percentile and those that lie above the upper limit, with the value of 95th
percentile.

If there is a significant number of outliers, they should be

treated separately in the statistical model. In that case, the
groups should be treated as two different groups, the model
should be built for both groups and then the output can be
combined.

2.5.2.2 Handling missing values

In a data set, one or more data elements may have missing
values in multiple records. As discussed above, it can be
caused by omission on part of the surveyor or a person who is
collecting sample data or by the responder, primarily due to
his/her unwillingness to respond or lack of understanding
needed to provide a response. It may happen that a specific
question (based on which the value of a data element
originates) is not applicable to a person or object with respect
to which data is collected. There are multiple strategies to
handle missing value of data elements. Some of those
strategies have been discussed below.

2.5.2.2.1 Eliminate records having a missing value of data elements

In case the proportion of data elements having missing values
is within a tolerable limit, a simple but effective approach is to
remove the records having such data elements. This is possible
if the quantum of data left after removing the data elements
having missing values is sizeable.

In the case of Auto MPG data set, only in 6 out of 398
records, the value of attribute �horsepower� is missing. If we
get rid of those 6 records, we will still have 392 records, which
is definitely a substantial number. So, we can very well
eliminate the records and keep working with the remaining
data set.

However, this will not be possible if the proportion of

records having data elements with missing value is really high
as that will reduce the power of model because of reduction in
the training data size.

2.5.2.2.2 Imputing missing values

Imputation is a method to assign a value to the data elements
having missing values. Mean/mode/median is most frequently
assigned value. For quantitative attributes, all missing values
are imputed with the mean, median, or mode of the remaining
values under the same attribute. For qualitative attributes, all
missing values are imputed by the mode of all remaining
values of the same attribute. However, another strategy may be
identify the similar types of observations whose values are
known and use the mean/median/mode of those known values.

For example, in context of the attribute �horsepower� of the
Auto MPG data set, since the attribute is quantitative, we take
a mean or median of the remaining data element values and
assign that to all data elements having a missing value. So, we
may assign the mean, which is 104.47 and assign it to all the
six data elements. The other approach is that we can take a
similarity based mean or median. If we refer to the six
observations with missing values for attribute �horsepower� as
depicted in Table 2.11, �cylinders� is the attribute which is
logically most connected to �horsepower� because with the
increase in number of cylinders of a car, the horsepower of the

car is expected to increase. So, for five observations, we can
use the mean of data elements of the �horsepower� attribute
having cylinders = 4; i.e. 78.28 and for one observation which
has cylinders = 6, we can use a similar mean of data elements
with cylinders = 6, i.e. 101.5, to impute value to the missing
data elements.

Table 2.11 Missing Values for �Horsepower� Attribute

2.5.2.2.3 Estimate missing values

If there are data points similar to the ones with missing
attribute values, then the attribute values from those similar
data points can be planted in place of the missing value. For
finding similar data points or observations, distance function
can be used.

For example, let�s assume that the weight of a Russian
student having age 12 years and height 5 ft. is missing. Then
the weight of any other Russian student having age close to 12
years and height close to 5 ft. can be assigned.

2.6 DATA PRE-PROCESSING

2.6.1 Dimensionality reduction

Till the end of the 1990s, very few domains were explored
which included data sets with a high number of attributes or
features. In general, the data sets used in machine learning
used to be in few 10s. However, in the last two decades, there
has been a rapid advent of computational biology like genome
projects. These projects have produced extremely high-
dimensional data sets with 20,000 or more features being very
common. Also, there has been a wide-spread adoption of
social networking leading to a need for text classification for
customer behaviour analysis.

High-dimensional data sets need a high amount of
computational space and time. At the same time, not all
features are useful � they degrade the performance of machine
learning algorithms. Most of the machine learning algorithms
perform better if the dimensionality of data set, i.e. the number
of features in the data set, is reduced. Dimensionality
reduction helps in reducing irrelevance and redundancy in
features. Also, it is easier to understand a model if the number
of features involved in the learning activity is less.

Dimensionality reduction refers to the techniques of
reducing the dimensionality of a data set by creating new
attributes by combining the original attributes. The most
common approach for dimensionality reduction is known as
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a statistical
technique to convert a set of correlated variables into a set of
transformed, uncorrelated variables called principal
components. The principal components are a linear
combination of the original variables. They are orthogonal to
each other. Since principal components are uncorrelated, they

capture the maximum amount of variability in the data.
However, the only challenge is that the original attributes are
lost due to the transformation.

Another commonly used technique which is used for
dimensionality reduction is Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD).

More about these concepts have been discussed in Chapter

4.

2.6.2 Feature subset selection

Feature subset selection or simply called feature selection,
both for supervised as well as unsupervised learning, try to
find out the optimal subset of the entire feature set which
significantly reduces computational cost without any major
impact on the learning accuracy. It may seem that a feature
subset may lead to loss of useful information as certain
features are going to be excluded from the final set of features
used for learning. However, for elimination only features
which are not relevant or redundant are selected.

A feature is considered as irrelevant if it plays an

insignificant role (or contributes almost no information) in
classifying or grouping together a set of data instances. All
irrelevant features are eliminated while selecting the final
feature subset. A feature is potentially redundant when the
information contributed by the feature is more or less same as
one or more other features. Among a group of potentially
redundant features, a small number of features can be selected
as a part of the final feature subset without causing any
negative impact to learn model accuracy.

There are different ways to select a feature subset. In
Chapter 4, we will be discussing feature selection in details.

2.7 SUMMARY

A data set is a collection of related information or records.
Data can be broadly divided into following two types

Qualitative data
Quantitative data

Qualitative data provides information about the quality of an object or
information which cannot be measured. Qualitative data can be further
subdivided into two types as follows:

Nominal data: has named value
Ordinal data: has named value which can be naturally ordered
Quantitative data relates to information about the quantity of an object �
hence it can be measured. There are two types of quantitative data:

Interval data: numeric data for which the exact difference between
values is known. However, such data do not have something called a
�true zero� value.
Ratio data: numeric data for which exact value can be measured and
absolute zero is available.

Measures of central tendency help to understand the central point of a set of
data. Standard measures of central tendency of data are mean, median, and
mode.
Detailed view of the data spread is available in the form of

Dispersion of data:extent of dispersion of a data is measured by
variance
Related to the position of the different data values there are five
values:minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3),
and maximum

Exploration of numerical data can be best done using box plots and
histograms.
Options for exploration of categorical data are very limited.
For exploring relations between variables, scatter-plots and two-way cross-
tabulations can be effectively used.
Success of machine learning depends largely on the quality of data. Two
common types of data issue are:
Data with a missing value
Data values which are surprisingly different termed as outliers

High-dimensional data sets need a high amount of computational space and
time. Most of the machine learning algorithms perform better if the
dimensionality of data set is reduced.
Some popular dimensionality reduction techniques are PCA, SVD, and
feature selection.

Modelling and Evaluation

OBJECTIVE OF THE CHAPTER :

The previous chapter gives a comprehensive understanding
of the basic data types in the context of machine learning.
It also enables a beginner in the field of machine learning
to acquire an understanding about the nature and quality of
the data by effective exploration of the data set. In this
chapter, the objective is to introduce the basic concepts of
learning. In this regard, the information shared concerns
the aspects of model selection and application. It also
imparts knowledge regarding how to judge the
effectiveness of the model in doing a specific learning task,
supervised or unsupervised, and how to boost the model
performance using different tuning parameters.

3.1 INTRODUCTION

The learning process of machines may seem quite magical to
somebody who is new to machine learning. The thought that a
machine is able to think and take intelligent action may be
mesmerizing � much like a science fiction or a fantasy story.

However, delving a bit deeper helps them realize that it is not
as magical as it may seem to be. In fact, it tries to emulate
human learning by applying mathematical and statistical
formulations. In that sense, both human and machine learning
strives to build formulations or mapping based on a limited
number of observations. As introduced in Chapter 1, the basic
learning process, irrespective of the fact that the learner is a
human or a machine, can be divided into three parts:

1. Data Input
2. Abstraction
3. Generalization

Though in Chapter 1 we have understood these aspects in
details, let�s quickly refresh our memory with an example. It�s
a fictitious situation. The detective department of New City
Police has got a tip that in a campaign gathering for the
upcoming election, a criminal is going to launch an attack on
the main candidate. However, it is not known who the person
is and quite obviously the person might use some disguise.
The only thing that is for sure is the person is a history-sheeter
or a criminal having a long record of serious crime. From the
criminal database, a list of such criminals along with their
photographs has been collected. Also, the photos taken by
security cameras positioned at different places near the
gathering are available with the detective department. They
have to match the photos from the criminal database with the
faces in the gathering to spot the potential attacker. So the
main problem here is to spot the face of the criminal based on
the match with the photos in the criminal database.

This can be done using human learning where a person from

the detective department can scan through each shortlisted
photo and try to match that photo with the faces in the
gathering. A person having a strong memory can take a glance

at the photos of all criminals in one shot and then try to find a
face in the gathering which closely resembles one of the
criminal photos that she has viewed. Easy, isn�t it? But that is
not possible in reality. The number of criminals in the database
and hence the count of photos runs in hundreds, if not
thousands. So taking a look at all the photos and memorizing
them is not possible. Also, an exact match is out of the
question as the criminal, in most probability, will come in
disguise. The strategy to be taken here is to match the photos
in smaller counts and also based on certain salient physical
features like the shape of the jaw, the slope of the forehead, the
size of the eyes, the structure of the ear, etc. So, the photos
from the criminal database form the input data. Based on it,
key features can be abstracted. Since human matching for each
and every photo may soon lead to a visual as well as mental
fatigue, a generalization of abstracted feature-based data is a
good way to detect potential criminal faces in the gathering.
For example, from the abstracted feature-based data, say it is
observed that most of the criminals have a shorter distance
between the inner corners of the eyes, a smaller angle between
the nose and the corners of the mouth, a higher curvature to
the upper lip, etc. Hence, a face in the gathering may be
classified as �potentially criminal� based on whether they
match with these generalized observations. Thus, using the
input data, feature-based abstraction could be built and by
applying generalization of the abstracted data, human learning
could classify the faces as potentially criminal ultimately
leading to spotting of the criminal.

The same thing can be done using machine learning too.
Unlike human detection, a machine has no subjective baggage,
no emotion, no bias due to past experience, and above all no
mental fatigue. The machine can also use the same input data,
i.e. criminal database photos, apply computational techniques

to abstract feature-based concept map from the input data and
generalize the same in the form of a classification algorithm to
decide whether a face in the gathering is potentially criminal
or not.

When we talk about the learning process, abstraction is a
significant step as it represents raw input data in a summarized
and structured format, such that a meaningful insight is
obtained from the data. This structured representation of raw
input data to the meaningful pattern is called a model. The
model might have different forms. It might be a mathematical
equation, it might be a graph or tree structure, it might be a
computational block, etc. The decision regarding which model
is to be selected for a specific data set is taken by the learning
task, based on the problem to be solved and the type of data.
For example, when the problem is related to prediction and the
target field is numeric and continuous, the regression model is
assigned. The process of assigning a model, and fitting a
specific model to a data set is called model training. Once the
model is trained, the raw input data is summarized into an
abstracted form.

However, with abstraction, the learner is able to only

summarize the knowledge. This knowledge might be still very
broad-based � consisting of a huge number of feature-based
data and inter-relations. To generate actionable insight from
such broad-based knowledge is very difficult. This is where
generalization comes into play. Generalization searches
through the huge set of abstracted knowledge to come up with
a small and manageable set of key findings. It is not possible
to do an exhaustive search by reviewing each of the abstracted
findings one-by-one. A  heuristic search is employed, an
approach which is also used for human learning (often termed
as �gut-feel�). It is quite obvious that the heuristics sometimes

result in erroneous result. If the outcome is systematically
incorrect, the learning is said to have a bias.

Points to Ponder:

A machine learning algorithm creates its cognitive capability by
building a mathematical formulation or function, known as target
function, based on the features in the input data set.
Just like a child learning things for the first time needs her parents
guidance to decide whether she is right or wrong, in machine learning
someone has to provide some non-learnable parameters, also called
hyper-parameters. Without these human inputs, machine learning
algorithms cannot be successful.

3.2 SELECTING A MODEL

Now that you are familiar with the basic learning process and
have understood model abstraction and generalization in that
context, let�s try to formalize it in context of a motivating
example. Continuing the thread of the potential attack during
the election campaign, New City Police department has
succeeded in foiling the bid to attack the electoral candidate.
However, this was a wake-up call for them and they want to
take a proactive action to eliminate all criminal activities in the
region. They want to find the pattern of criminal activities in
the recent past, i.e. they want to see whether the number of
criminal incidents per month has any relation with an average
income of the local population, weapon sales, the inflow of
immigrants, and other such factors. Therefore, an association
between potential causes of disturbance and criminal incidents
has to be determined. In other words, the goal or target is to
develop a model to infer how the criminal incidents change
based on the potential influencing factors mentioned above.

In machine learning paradigm, the potential causes of
disturbance, e.g. average income of the local population,
weapon sales, the inflow of immigrants, etc. are input
variables. They are also called predictors, attributes, features,
independent variables, or simply variables. The number of
criminal incidents is an output variable (also called response or
dependent variable). Input variables can be denoted by X,
while individual input variables are represented as X , X , X ,
3
2
�, X  and output variable by symbol Y. The relationship
between X and Y is represented in the general form: Y = f (X) +
e, where �f � is the target function and �e� is a random error
term.

1

n

Note:

Just like a target function with respect to a machine
learning model, some other functions which are frequently
tracked are

A cost function (also called error function) helps to measure the
extent to which the model is going wrong in estimating the relationship
between X and Y. In that sense, cost function can tell how bad the model
is performing. For example, R-squared (to be discussed later in this
chapter) is a cost function of regression model.
Loss function is almost synonymous to cost function � only difference
being loss function is usually a function defined on a data point, while
cost function is for the entire training data set.
Machine learning is an optimization problem. We try to define a model
and tune the parameters to find the most suitable solution to a problem.
However, we need to have a way to evaluate the quality or optimality of
a solution. This is done using objective function. Objective means
goal.
Objective function takes in data and model (along with parameters) as
input and returns a value. Target is to find values of model parameter to
maximize or minimize the return value. When the objective is to
minimize the value, it becomes synonymous to cost function. Examples:

maximize the reward function in reinforcement learning, maximize the
posterior probability in Naive Bayes, minimize squared error in
regression.

But the problem that we just talked about is one specific
type of problem in machine learning. We have seen in Chapter
1 that there are three broad categories of machine learning
approaches used for resolving different types of problems.
Quickly recapitulating, they are

1. Supervised

1. Classification
2. Regression

2. Unsupervised
1. Clustering
2. Association analysis

3. Reinforcement

For each of the cases, the model that has to be

created/trained is different. Multiple factors play a role when
we try to select the model for solving a machine learning
problem. The most important factors are (i) the kind of
problem we want to solve using machine learning and (ii) the
nature of the underlying data. The problem may be related to
the prediction of a class value like whether a tumour is
malignant or benign, whether the next day will be snowy or
rainy, etc. It may be related to prediction � but of some
numerical value like what the price of a house should be in the
next quarter, what is the expected growth of a certain IT stock
in the next 7 days, etc. Certain problems are related to
grouping of data like finding customer segments that are using
a certain product, movie genres which have got more box
office success in the last one year, etc. So, it is very difficult to
give a generic guidance related to which machine learning has
to be selected. In other words, there is no one model that

works best for every machine learning problem. This is what
�No Free Lunch� theorem also states.

Any learning model tries to simulate some real-world

aspect. However, it is simplified to a large extent removing all
intricate details. These simplifications are based on certain
assumptions � which are quite dependent on situations. Based
on the exact situation, i.e. the problem in hand and the data
characteristics, assumptions may or may not hold. So the same
model may yield remarkable results in a certain situation while
it may completely fail in a different situation. That�s why,
while doing the data exploration, which we covered in the
previous chapter, we need to understand the data
characteristics, combine this understanding with the problem
we are trying to solve and then decide which model to be
selected for solving the problem.

Let�s try to understand the philosophy of model selection in
a structured way. Machine learning algorithms are broadly of
two types: models for supervised learning, which primarily
focus on solving predictive problems and models for
unsupervised learning, which solve descriptive problems.

3.2.1 Predictive models

Models for supervised learning or predictive models, as is
understandable from the name itself, try to predict certain
value using the values in an input data set. The learning model
attempts to establish a relation between the target feature, i.e.
the feature being predicted, and the predictor features. The
predictive models have a clear focus on what they want to
learn and how they want to learn.

Predictive models, in turn, may need to predict the value of
a category or class to which a data instance belongs to. Below
are some examples:

1. Predicting win/loss in a cricket match
2. Predicting whether a transaction is fraud
3. Predicting whether a customer may move to another product

The models which are used for prediction of target features

of categorical value are known as classification models. The
target feature is known as a class and the categories to which
classes are divided into are called levels. Some of the popular
classification models include k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN),
Na�ve Bayes, and Decision Tree.

Predictive models may also be used to predict numerical
values of the target feature based on the predictor features.
Below are some examples:

1. Prediction of revenue growth in the succeeding year
2. Prediction of rainfall amount in the coming monsoon
3. Prediction of potential flu patients and demand for flu shots next winter

The models which are used for prediction of the numerical

value of the target feature of a data instance are known as
regression models. Linear Regression and Logistic Regression
models are popular regression models.

Points to Ponder:

Categorical values can be converted to numerical values and vice versa.
For example, for stock price growth prediction, any growth percentage
lying between certain ranges may be represented by a categorical value,
e.g. 0%�5% as �low�, 5%�10% as �moderate�, 10%�20% as �high� and
> 20% as �booming�. In a similar way, a categorical value can be
converted to numerical value, e.g. in the tumor malignancy detection

problem, replace �benign� as 0 and �malignant� as 1. This way, the
models can be used interchangeably, though it may not work always.
There are multiple factors to be considered while selecting a model. For
example, while selecting the model for prediction, the training data size
is an important factor to be considered. If the training data set is small,
low variance models like Na�ve Bayes are supposed to perform better
because model overfitting needs to be avoided in this situation.
Similarly, when the training data is large, low bias models like logistic
regression should be preferred because they can represent complex
relationships in a more effective way.

Few models like Support Vector Machines and Neural
Network can be used for both classifications as well as for
regression.

3.2.2 Descriptive models

Models for unsupervised learning or descriptive models are
used to describe a data set or gain insight from a data set.
There is no target feature or single feature of interest in case of
unsupervised learning. Based on the value of all features,
interesting patterns or insights are derived about the data set.

Descriptive models which group together similar data
instances, i.e. data instances having a similar value of the
different features are called clustering models. Examples of
clustering include

1. Customer grouping or segmentation based on social, demographic, ethnic,

etc. factors

2. Grouping of music based on different aspects like genre, language, time-

period, etc.

3. Grouping of commodities in an inventory

The most popular model for clustering is k-Means.

Descriptive models related to pattern discovery is used for
market basket analysis of transactional data. In market basket
analysis, based on the purchase pattern available in the
transactional data, the possibility of purchasing one product
based on the purchase of another product is determined. For
example, transactional data may reveal a pattern that generally
a customer who purchases milk also purchases biscuit at the
same time. This can be useful for targeted promotions or in-
store set up. Promotions related to biscuits can be sent to
customers of milk products or vice versa. Also, in the store
products related to milk can be placed close to biscuits.

3.3 TRAINING A MODEL (FOR SUPERVISED LEARNING)

3.3.1 Holdout method

In case of supervised learning, a model is trained using the
labelled input data. However, how can we understand the
performance of the model? The test data may not be available
immediately. Also, the label value of the test data is not
known. That is the reason why a part of the input data is held
back (that is how the name holdout originates) for evaluation
of the model. This subset of the input data is used as the test
data for evaluating the performance of a trained model. In
general 70%�80% of the input data (which is obviously
labelled) is used for model training. The remaining 20%�30%
is used as test data for validation of the performance of the
model. However, a different proportion of dividing the input
data into training and test data is also acceptable. To make sure
that the data in both the buckets are similar in nature, the
division is done randomly. Random numbers are used to assign
data items to the partitions. This method of partitioning the
input data into two parts � training and test data (depicted in

Figure 3.1), which is by holding back a part of the input data
for validating the trained model is known as holdout method.

FIG. 3.1 Holdout method

Once the model is trained using the training data, the labels
of the test data are predicted using the model�s target function.
Then the predicted value is compared with the actual value of
the label. This is possible because the test data is a part of the
input data with known labels. The performance of the model is
in general measured by the accuracy of prediction of the label
value.

In certain cases, the input data is partitioned into three

portions � a training and a test data, and a third validation data.
The validation data is used in place of test data, for measuring
the model performance. It is used in iterations and to refine the
model in each iteration. The test data is used only for once,
after the model is refined and finalized, to measure and report
the final performance of the model as a reference for future
learning efforts.

An obvious problem in this method is that the division of
data of different classes into the training and test data may not
be proportionate. This situation is worse if the overall
percentage of data related to certain classes is much less
compared to other classes. This may happen despite the fact
that random sampling is employed for test data selection. This
problem can be addressed to some extent by applying stratified
random sampling in place of sampling. In case of stratified
random sampling, the whole data is broken into several
homogenous groups or strata and a random sample is selected
from each such stratum. This ensures that the generated
random partitions have equal proportions of each class.

3.3.2 K-fold Cross-validation method

Holdout method employing stratified random sampling
approach still heads into issues in certain specific situations.
Especially, the smaller data sets may have the challenge to
divide the data of some of the classes proportionally amongst
training and test data sets. A special variant of holdout
method, called repeated holdout, is sometimes employed to
ensure the randomness of the composed data sets. In repeated
holdout, several random holdouts are used to measure the
model performance. In the end, the average of all
performances is taken. As multiple holdouts have been drawn,
the training and test data (and also validation data, in case it is
drawn) are more likely to contain representative data from all
classes and resemble the original input data closely. This
process of repeated holdout is the basis of k-fold cross-
validation technique. In k-fold cross-validation, the data set is
divided into k-completely distinct or non-overlapping random
partitions called folds. Figure 3.2 depicts an overall approach
for k-fold cross-validation.

The value of �k� in k-fold cross-validation can be set to any

number. However, there are two approaches which are
extremely popular:

1. 10-fold cross-validation (10-fold CV)
2. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)

10-fold cross-validation is by far the most popular approach.

In this approach, for each of the 10-folds, each comprising of
approximately 10% of the data, one of the folds is used as the
test data for validating model performance trained based on
the remaining 9 folds (or 90% of the data). This is repeated 10
times, once for each of the 10 folds being used as the test data
and the remaining folds as the training data.The average
performance across all folds is being reported. Figure 3.3
depicts the detailed approach of selecting the �k� folds in k-fold
cross-validation. As can be observed in the figure, each of the
circles resembles a record in the input data set whereas the
different colors indicate the different classes that the records
belong to.The entire data set is broken into �k� folds � out of
which one fold is selected in each iteration as the test data set.
The fold selected as test data set in each of the �k� iterations is
different. Also, note that though in figure 3.3 the circles
resemble the records in the input data set, the contiguous
circles represented as folds do not mean that they are
subsequent records in the data set. This is more a virtual
representation and not a physical representation. As already
mentioned, the records in a fold are drawn by using random
sampling technique.

FIG. 3.2 Overall approach for K-fold cross-validation

FIG. 3.3 Detailed approach for fold selection

Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) is an extreme

case of k-fold cross-validation using one record or data
instance at a time as a test data. This is done to maximize the
count of data used to train the model. It is obvious that the
number of iterations for which it has to be run is equal to the
total number of data in the input data set. Hence, obviously, it
is computationally very expensive and not used much in
practice.

3.3.3 Bootstrap sampling

Bootstrap sampling or simply bootstrapping is a popular way
to identify training and test data sets from the input data set. It
uses the technique of Simple Random Sampling with
Replacement (SRSWR), which is a well-known technique in
sampling theory for drawing random samples. We have seen
earlier that k-fold cross-validation divides the data into
separate partitions � say 10 partitions in case of 10-fold cross-
validation. Then it uses data instances from partition as test
data and the remaining partitions as training data. Unlike this
approach adopted in case of k-fold cross- validation,
bootstrapping randomly picks data instances from the input
data set, with the possibility of the same data instance to be
picked multiple times. This essentially means that from the
input data set having �n� data instances, bootstrapping can
create one or more training data sets having �n� data instances,
some of the data instances being repeated multiple times.
Figure 3.4 briefly presents the approach followed in bootstrap
sampling.

This technique is particularly useful in case of input data

sets of small size, i.e.  having very less number of data
instances.

FIG. 3.4 Bootstrap sampling

3.3.4 Lazy vs. Eager learner

Eager learning follows the general principles of machine
learning � it tries to construct a generalized, input-independent
target function during the model training phase. It follows the
typical steps of machine learning, i.e. abstraction and
generalization and comes up with a trained model at the end of
the learning phase. Hence, when the test data comes in for
classification, the eager learner is ready with the model and

doesn�t need to refer back to the training data. Eager learners
take more time in the learning phase than the lazy learners.
Some of the algorithms which adopt eager learning approach
include Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Neural
Network, etc.

Lazy learning, on the other hand, completely skips the
abstraction and generalization processes, as explained in
context of a typical machine learning process. In that respect,
strictly speaking, lazy learner doesn�t �learn� anything. It uses
the training data in exact, and uses the knowledge to classify
the unlabelled test data. Since lazy learning uses training data
as-is, it is also known as rote learning (i.e. memorization
technique based on repetition). Due to its heavy dependency
on the given training data instance, it is also known as instance
learning. They are also called non-parametric learning. Lazy
learners take very little time in training because not much of
training actually happens. However, it takes quite some time in
classification as for each tuple of test data, a comparison-based
assignment of label happens. One of the most popular
algorithm for lazy learning is k-nearest neighbor.

Note:

Parametric learning models have finite number of
parameters. In case of non-parametric models, quite
contradicting to its name, the number of parameters is
potentially infinite.

Models such as Linear Regression and Support Vector

Machine, since the coefficients form the learning
parameters, they are fixed in size. Hence, these models are

clubbed as parametric.On the other hand, in case of models
such as k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and decision tree,
number of parameters grows with the size of the training
data. Hence, they are considered as non-parametric
learning models.

3.4 MODEL REPRESENTATION AND INTERPRETABILITY

We have already seen that the goal of supervised machine
learning is to learn or derive a target function which can best
determine the target variable from the set of input variables. A
key consideration in learning the target function from the
training data is the extent of generalization. This is because the
input data is just a limited, specific view and the new,
unknown data in the test data set may be differing quite a bit
from the training data.

Fitness of a target function approximated by a learning
algorithm determines how correctly it is able to classify a set
of data it has never seen.

3.4.1 Underfitting

If the target function is kept too simple, it may not be able to
capture the essential nuances and represent the underlying data
well. A typical case of underfitting may occur when trying to
represent a non-linear data with a linear model as
demonstrated by both cases of underfitting shown in figure
3.5. Many times underfitting happens due to unavailability of
sufficient training data. Underfitting results in both poor
performance with training data as well as poor generalization
to test data. Underfitting can be avoided by

1. using more training data
2. reducing features by effective feature selection

FIG. 3.5 Underfitting and Overfitting of models

3.4.2 Overfitting

Overfitting refers to a situation where the model has been
designed in such a way that it emulates the training data too
closely. In such a case, any specific deviation in the training
data, like noise or outliers, gets embedded in the model. It
adversely impacts the performance of the model on the test
data. Overfitting, in many cases, occur as a result of trying to
fit an excessively complex model to closely match the training
data. This is represented with a sample data set in figure 3.5 .
The target function, in these cases, tries to make sure all
training data points are correctly partitioned by the decision
boundary. However, more often than not, this exact nature is
not replicated in the unknown test data set. Hence, the target
function results in wrong classification in the test data set.
Overfitting results in good performance with training data set,

but poor generalization and hence poor performance with test
data set. Overfitting can be avoided by

1. using re-sampling techniques like k-fold cross validation
2. hold back of a validation data set
3. remove the nodes which have little or no predictive power for the given

machine learning problem.

Both underfitting and overfitting result in poor classification

quality which is reflected by low classification accuracy.

3.4.3 Bias � variance trade-off

In supervised learning, the class value assigned by the learning
model built based on the training data may differ from the
actual class value. This error in learning can be of two types �
errors due to �bias� and error due to �variance�. Let�s try to
understand each of them in details.

3.4.3.1 Errors due to �Bias�

Errors due to bias arise from simplifying assumptions made by
the model to make the target function less complex or easier to
learn. In short, it is due to underfitting of the model.
Parametric models generally have high bias making them
easier to understand/interpret and faster to learn. These
algorithms have a poor performance on data sets, which are
complex in nature and do not align with the simplifying
assumptions made by the algorithm. Underfitting results in
high bias.

3.4.3.2 Errors due to �Variance�

Errors due to variance occur from difference in training data
sets used to train the model. Different training data sets
(randomly sampled from the input data set) are used to train

the model. Ideally the difference in the data sets should not be
significant and the model trained using different training data
sets should not be too different. However, in case of
overfitting, since the model closely matches the  training data,
even a small difference in training data gets magnified in
the model.

FIG. 3.6 Bias-variance trade-off

So, the problems in training a model can either happen
because either (a) the model is too simple and hence fails to
interpret the data grossly or (b) the model is extremely

complex and magnifies even small differences in the training
data.

As is quite understandable:

Increasing the bias will decrease the variance, and
Increasing the variance will decrease the bias

On one hand, parametric algorithms are generally seen to
demonstrate high bias but low variance. On the other hand,
non-parametric algorithms demonstrate low bias and high
variance.

As can be observed in Figure 3.6 , the best solution is to
have a model with low bias as well as low variance. However,
that may not be possible in reality. Hence, the goal of
supervised machine learning is to achieve a balance between
bias and variance. The learning algorithm chosen and the user
parameters which can be configured helps in striking a trade-
off between bias and variance. For example, in a popular
supervised algorithm k-Nearest Neighbors or kNN, the user
configurable parameter �k� can be used to do a trade-off
between bias and variance. In one hand, when the value of �k�
is decreased, the model becomes simpler to fit and bias
increases. On the other hand, when the value of �k� is
increased, the variance increases.

3.5 EVALUATING PERFORMANCE OF A MODEL

3.5.1 Supervised learning - classification

In supervised learning, one major task is classification. The
responsibility of the classification model is to assign class
label to the target feature based on the value of the predictor
features. For example, in the problem of predicting the

win/loss in a cricket match, the classifier will assign a class
value win/loss to target feature based on the values of other
features like whether the team won the toss, number of
spinners in the team, number of wins the team had in the
tournament, etc. To evaluate the performance of the model, the
number of correct classifications or predictions made by the
model has to be recorded. A classification is said to be correct
if, say for example in the given problem, it has been predicted
by the model that the team will win and it has actually won.

Based on the number of correct and incorrect classifications

or predictions made by a model, the accuracy of the model is
calculated. If 99 out of 100 times the model has classified
correctly, e.g. if in 99 out of 100 games what the model has
predicted is same as what the outcome has been, then the
model accuracy is said to be 99%. However, it is quite relative
to say whether a model has performed well just by looking at
the accuracy value. For example, 99% accuracy in case of a
sports win predictor model may be reasonably good but the
same number may not be acceptable as a good threshold when
the learning problem deals with predicting a critical illness. In
this case, even the 1% incorrect prediction may lead to loss of
many lives. So the model performance needs to be evaluated
in light of the learning problem in question. Also, in certain
cases, erring on the side of caution may be preferred at the cost
of overall accuracy. For that reason, we need to look more
closely at the model accuracy and also at the same time look at
other measures of performance of a model like sensitivity,
specificity, precision, etc. So, let�s start with looking at model
accuracy more closely. And let�s try to understand it with an
example.

There are four possibilities with regards to the cricket match

win/loss prediction:

1. the model predicted win and the team won
2. the model predicted win and the team lost
3. the model predicted loss and the team won
4. the model predicted loss and the team lost

In this problem, the obvious class of interest is �win�.

The first case, i.e. the model predicted win and the team
won is a case where the model has correctly classified data
instances as the class of interest. These cases are referred as
True Positive (TP) cases.

The second case, i.e. the model predicted win and the team

lost is a case where the model incorrectly classified data
instances as the class of interest. These cases are referred as
False Positive (FP) cases.

The third case, i.e. the model predicted loss and the team
won is a case where the model has incorrectly classified as not
the class of interest. These cases are referred as False Negative
(FN) cases.

FIG. 3.7 Details of model classification

The fourth case, i.e. the model predicted loss and the team
lost is a case where the model has correctly classified as not
the class of interest. These cases are referred as True Negative
(TN) cases. All these four cases are depicted in Figure 3.7 .

For any classification model, model accuracy is given by
total number of correct classifications (either as the class of
interest, i.e. True Positive or as not the class of interest, i.e.
True Negative) divided by total number of classifications
done.

A matrix containing correct and incorrect predictions in the

form of TPs, FPs, FNs and TNs is known as confusion
matrix. The win/loss prediction of cricket match has two
classes of interest � win and loss. For that reason it will
generate a 2 � 2 confusion matrix. For a classification problem
involving three classes, the confusion matrix would be 3 � 3,
etc.

Let�s assume the confusion matrix of the win/loss prediction

of cricket match problem to be as below:

In context of the above confusion matrix, total count of TPs
= 85, count of FPs = 4, count of FNs = 2 and count of TNs = 9.

The percentage of misclassifications is indicated using

error rate which is measured as

In context of the above confusion matrix,

Sometimes, correct prediction, both TPs as well as TNs,
may happen by mere coincidence. Since these occurrences
boost model accuracy, ideally it should not happen. Kappa
value of a model indicates the adjusted the model accuracy. It
is calculated using the formula below:

In context of the above confusion matrix, total count of TPs
= 85, count of FPs = 4, count of FNs = 2 and count of TNs = 9.

Note:

Kappa value can be 1 at the maximum, which represents
perfect agreement between model�s prediction and actual
values.

As discussed earlier, in certain learning problems it is

critical to have extremely low number of FN cases, if needed,
at the cost of a conservative classification model. Though it is
a clear case of misclassification and will impact model
accuracy adversely, it is still required as missing each class of
interest may have serious consequence. This happens more in
problems from medical domains like disease prediction
problem. For example, if a tumor is malignant but wrongly
classified as benign by the classifier, then the repercussion of
such misclassification is fatal. It does not matter if higher
number of tumours which are benign are wrongly classified as
malignant. In these problems there are some measures of
model performance which are more important than accuracy.
Two such critical measurements are sensitivity and specificity
of the model.

The sensitivity of a model measures the proportion of TP
examples or positive cases which were correctly classified. It
is measured as

In the context of the above confusion matrix for the cricket

match win prediction problem,

So, again taking the example of the malignancy prediction

of tumours, class of interest is �malignant�. Sensitivity
measure gives the proportion of tumours which are actually
malignant and have been predicted as malignant. It is quite
obvious that for such problems the most critical measure of the
performance of a good model is sensitivity. A high value of
sensitivity is more desirable than a high value of accuracy.

Specificity is also another good measure to indicate a good

balance of a model being excessively conservative or
excessively aggressive. Specificity of a model measures the
proportion of negative examples which have been correctly
classified. In the context, of malignancy prediction of tumours,
specificity gives the proportion of benign tumours which have
been correctly classified. In the context of the above confusion
matrix for the cricket match win prediction problem,

A higher value of specificity will indicate a better model

performance. However, it is quite understandable that a
conservative approach to reduce False Negatives might
actually push up the number of FPs. Reason for this is that the
model, in order to reduce FNs, is going to classify more
tumours as malignant. So  the chance that benign tumours will
be classified as malignant or FPs will increase.

There are two other performance measures of a supervised
learning model which are similar to sensitivity and specificity.
These are precision and recall. While precision gives the
proportion of positive predictions which are truly positive,
recall gives the proportion of TP cases over all actually
positive cases.

Precision indicates the reliability of a model in predicting a

class of interest. When the model is related to win / loss
prediction of cricket, precision indicates how often it predicts
the win correctly. In context of the above confusion matrix for
the cricket match win prediction problem,

It is quite understandable that a model with higher precision

is perceived to be more reliable.

Recall indicates the proportion of correct prediction of
positives to the total number of positives. In case of win/loss

prediction of cricket, recall resembles what proportion of the
total wins were predicted correctly.

In the context of the above confusion matrix for the cricket

match win prediction problem,

3.5.1.1 F-measure

F-measure is another measure of model performance which
combines the precision and recall. It takes the harmonic mean
of precision and recall as calculated as

In context of the above confusion matrix for the cricket

match win prediction problem,

As a combination of multiple measures into one, F-score
gives the right measure using which performance of different
models can be compared. However, one assumption the
calculation is based on is that precision and recall have equal
weight, which may not always be true in reality. In certain
problems, the disease prediction problems, e.g., precision may

be given far more weightage. In that case, different weightages
may be assigned to precision and recall. However, there may
be a serious dilemma regarding what value to be adopted for
each and what is the basis for the specific value adopted.

3.5.1.1.1 Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves

As we have seen till now, though accuracy is the most popular
measure, there are quite a number of other measures to
evaluate the performance of a supervised learning model.
However, visualization is an easier and more effective way to
understand the model performance. It also helps in comparing
the efficiency of two models.

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve helps in
visualizing the performance of a classification model. It shows
the efficiency of a model in the detection of true positives
while avoiding the occurrence of false positives. To refresh our
memory, true positives are those cases where the model has
correctly classified data instances as the class of interest. For
example, the model has correctly classified the tumours as
malignant, in case of a tumour malignancy prediction problem.
On the other hand, FPs are those cases where the model
incorrectly classified data instances as the class of interest.
Using the same example, in this case, the model has
incorrectly classified the tumours as malignant, i.e. tumours
which are actually benign have been classified as malignant.

In the ROC curve, the FP rate is plotted (in the horizontal
axis) against true positive rate (in the vertical axis) at different
classification thresholds. If we assume a lower value of
classification threshold, the model classifies more items as
positive. Hence, the values of both False Positives and True
Positives increase. The area under curve (AUC) value, as
shown in figure 3.8a , is the area of the two-dimensional space
under the curve extending from (0, 0) to (1, 1), where each
point on the curve gives a set of true and false positive values
at a specific classification threshold. This curve gives an
indication of the predictive quality of a model. AUC value
ranges from 0 to 1, with an AUC of less than 0.5 indicating
that the classifier has no predictive ability. Figure 3.8b shows
the curves of two classifiers � classifier 1 and classifier 2.
Quite obviously, the AUC of classifier 1 is more than the AUC
of classifier 2. So, we can draw the inference that classifier 1 is
better than classifier 2.

FIG. 3.8 ROC curve

A quick indicative interpretation of the predictive values

from 0.5 to 1.0 is given below:

0.5 � 0.6 ? Almost no predictive ability
0.6 � 0.7 ? Weak predictive ability
0.7 � 0.8 ? Fair predictive ability
0.8 � 0.9 ? Good predictive ability
0.9 � 1.0 ? Excellent predictive ability

3.5.2 Supervised learning � regression

A well-fitted regression model churns out predicted values
close to actual values. Hence, a regression model which
ensures that the difference between predicted and actual values
is low can be considered as a good model. Figure 3.9
represents a very simple problem of real estate value
prediction solved using linear regression model. If �area� is the
predictor variable (say x) and �value� is the target variable (say
y), the linear regression model can be represented in the form:

FIG. 3.9 Error � Predicted vs. actual value

For a certain value of x, say x?, the value of y is predicted as

? whereas the actual value of y is Y (say). The distance
between the actual value and the fitted or predicted value, i.e. ?
is known as residual. The regression model can be considered
to be fitted well if the difference between actual and predicted
value, i.e. the residual value is less.

R-squared is a good measure to evaluate the model fitness.

It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or for
multiple regression, the coefficient of multiple determination.
The R-squared value lies between 0 to 1 (0%�100%) with a
larger value representing a better fit. It is calculated as:

Sum of Squares Total (SST) = squared differences of each

observation from the overall mean =

 where y? is the

mean.

Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) (of prediction) = sum of the

squared residuals =

 where

 is the predicted value

of y and Y is the actual value of y
i.

3.5.3 Unsupervised learning - clustering

Clustering algorithms try to reveal natural groupings amongst
the data sets. However, it is quite tricky to evaluate the
performance of a clustering algorithm. Clustering, by nature, is
very subjective and whether the cluster is good or bad is open
for interpretations. It was noted, �clustering is in the eye of the
beholder�. This stems from the two inherent challenges which
lie in the process of clustering:

1. It is generally not known how many clusters can be formulated from a

particular data set. It is completely open-ended in most cases and
provided as a user input to a clustering algorithm.

2. Even if the number of clusters is given, the same number of clusters can

be formed with different groups of data instances.

In a more objective way, it can be said that a clustering
algorithm is successful if the clusters identified using the
algorithm is able to achieve the right results in the overall
problem domain. For example, if clustering is applied for

identifying customer segments for a marketing campaign of a
new product launch, the clustering can be considered
successful only if the marketing campaign ends with a
success,i.e. it is able to create the right brand recognition
resulting in steady revenue from new product sales. However,
there are couple of popular approaches which are adopted for
cluster quality evaluation.

1. Internal evaluation

of

data

belonging

In this approach, the cluster is assessed based on the underlying data that was
clustered. The internal evaluation methods generally measure cluster quality
based  on  homogeneity  of  data  belonging  to  the  same  cluster  and
clusters.  The
heterogeneity
homogeneity/heterogeneity  is  decided  by  some  similarity  measure.  For
example,  silhouette  coefficient,  which  is  one  of  the  most  popular  internal
evaluation  methods,  uses  distance  (Euclidean  or  Manhattan  distances  most
commonly used) between data elements as a similarity measure. The value of
silhouette width ranges between �1 and +1, with a high value indicating high
intra-cluster homogeneity and inter-cluster heterogeneity.
For a data set clustered into �k� clusters, silhouette width is calculated as:

different

to

a(i) is the average distance between the i th data instance and all other data
instances  belonging  to  the  same  cluster  and  b(i)  is  the  lowest  average
distance  between  the  i-the  data  instance  and  data  instances  of  all  other
clusters.
Let�s try to understand this in context of the example depicted in figure 3.10.
There  are  four  clusters  namely  cluster  1,  2,  3,  and  4.  Let�s  consider  an
arbitrary data element �i�  in  cluster  1,  resembled  by  the  asterisk.  a(i)  is the
average of the distances a , a , �, a  of the different data elements from
in1
the  i  th  data  element  in  cluster  1,  assuming  there  are  n   data  elements  in
cluster 1. Mathematically,

i2

i1

1

FIG. 3.10 Silhouette width calculation

In the same way, let�s calculate the distance of an arbitrary data element �i� in
cluster 1 with the different data elements from another cluster, say cluster 4
and take an average of all those distances. Hence,

4

where n   is the total number  of elements in cluster 4. In the same  way, we
can  calculate  the  values  of  b   (average)  and  b   (average).  b  (i)  is  the
13
minimum of all these values. Hence, we can say that,

12

b(i) = minimum [b (average), b (average), b (average)]

13

14

12

2. External evaluation

In this approach, class label is known for the data set subjected to clustering.
However, quite obviously, the known class labels are not a part of the data
used in clustering. The cluster algorithm is assessed based on how close the

results are compared to those known class labels. For example, purity is one
of the most popular measures of cluster algorithms � evaluates the extent to
which clusters contain a single class.

For a data set having �n� data instances and �c� known class labels which

generates �k� clusters, purity is measured as:

3.6 IMPROVING PERFORMANCE OF A MODEL

Now we have almost reached the end of the journey of
building learning models. We have got some idea about what
modelling is, how to approach about it to solve a learning
problem and how to measure the success of our model. Now
comes a million dollar question. Can we improve the
performance of our model? If so, then what are the levers for
improving the performance? In fact, even before that comes
the question of model selection � which model should be
selected for which machine learning task? We have already
discussed earlier that the model selection is done one several
aspects:

1. Type of learning the task in hand, i.e. supervised or unsupervised
2. Type of the data, i.e. categorical or numeric
3. Sometimes on the problem domain
4. Above all, experience in working with different models to solve

problems of diverse domains

So, assuming that the model selection is done, what are the

different avenues to improve the performance of models?

One effective way to improve model performance is by
tuning model parameter. Model parameter tuning is the
process of adjusting the model fitting options. For example, in
the popular classification model k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN),
using different values of �k� or the number of nearest

neighbours to be considered, the model can be tuned. In the
same way, a number of hidden layers can be adjusted to tune
the performance in neural networks model. Most machine
learning models have at least one parameter which can be
tuned.

As an alternate approach of increasing the performance of

one model, several models may be combined together. The
models in such combination are complimentary to each other,
i.e. one model may learn one type data sets well while struggle
with another type of data set. Another model may perform
well with the data set which the first one struggled with. This
approach of combining different models with diverse strengths
is known as ensemble (depicted in Figure 3.11 ). Ensemble
helps in averaging out biases of the different underlying
models and also reducing the variance. Ensemble methods
combine weaker learners to create stronger ones. A
performance boost can be expected even if models are built as
usual and then ensembled. Following are the typical steps in
ensemble process:

Build a number of models based on the training data
For diversifying the models generated, the training data subset can be varied
using the allocation function. Sampling techniques like bootstrapping may be
used to generate unique training data sets.
Alternatively, the same training data may be used but the models combined
are quite varying, e.g, SVM, neural network, kNN, etc.
The outputs from the different models are combined using a combination
function. A very simple strategy of combining, say in case of a prediction
task using ensemble, can be majority voting of the different models
combined. For example, 3 out of 5 classes predict �win� and 2 predict �loss� �
then the final outcome of the ensemble using majority vote would be a �win�.

FIG. 3.11 Ensemble

One of the earliest and most popular ensemble models is
bootstrap aggregating or bagging. Bagging uses bootstrap
sampling method (refer section 3.3.3) to generate multiple
training data sets. These training data sets are used to generate
(or train) a set of models using the same learning algorithm.
Then the outcomes of the models are combined by majority
voting (classification) or by average (regression). Bagging is a
very simple ensemble technique which can perform really well
for unstable learners like a decision tree, in which a slight
change in data can impact the outcome of a model
significantly.

Just like bagging, boosting is another key ensemble-based
technique. In this type of ensemble, weaker learning models
are trained on resampled data and the outcomes are combined
using a weighted voting approach based on the performance of
different models. Adaptive boosting or AdaBoost is a special

variant of boosting algorithm. It is based on the idea of
generating weak learners and slowly learning

Random forest is another ensemble-based technique. It is
an ensemble of decision trees � hence the name random forest
to indicate a forest of decision trees. It has been discussed in
more details in chapter 7.

In this chapter, you have been introduced to the crux of
machine learning, i.e. modelling. Thorough understanding of
the technical aspects elaborated in this chapter is extremely
crucial for the success of any machine learning project.
For example, the first dilemma comes about which model to
select. Again, in case of supervised learning, how can we deal
with the unavailability of sufficient training data. In the same
way, once the model is trained in case of supervised learning
or the grouping is done in case of clustering, how we can
understand whether the model training (for supervised) or
grouping done (for unsupervised) is good or bad. All these and
more have been addressed as a part of this chapter.

3.7 SUMMARY

Structured representation of raw input data to the meaningful pattern is
called a model.
The process of fitting a specific model to a data set is called model training.
Models for supervised learning or predictive models try to predict certain
value using the input data set.
Models for unsupervised learning or descriptive models are used to describe
a data set or gain insight from a data set.
The method of partitioning the input data into two parts � training and test
data, which is holding back a part of the input data for validating the trained
model is known as holdout method.
In k-fold cross-validation technique, the data set is divided into k- completely
separate random partitions called folds. It is basically repeated holdout into

�k� folds. The value of �k� in k-fold cross-validation can be set to any
number. Two extremely popular approaches are:
10-fold cross-validation (10-fold CV)
Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)

Bootstrap sampling or simply bootstrapping is a popular way to identify
training and test data sets from the input data set. It uses the technique of
Simple Random Sampling with Replacement (SRSWR). Bootstrapping
randomly picks data instances from the input data set, with the possibility of
the same data instance to be picked multiple times.
Target function of a model is the function defining the relationship between
the input (also called predictor or independent) variables and the output (also
called response or dependent or target) variable. It is represented in the
general form: Y = f (X) + e, where Y is the output variable, X represents the
input variables and �e� is a random error term.
Fitness of a target function approximated by a learning algorithm determines
how correctly it is able to predict the value or class for a set of data it has
never seen.
If the target function is kept too simple, it may not be able to capture the
essential nuances and represent the underlying data well. This known as
underfitting.
Overfitting refers to a situation where the model has been designed in such a
way that it emulates the training data too closely. In such a case, any specific
nuance in the training data, like noise or outliers, gets embedded in the
model. It adversely impacts the performance of the model on the test data.
In supervised learning, the value predicted by the learning model built based
on the training data may differ from the actual class value. This error in
learning can be of two types � errors due to �bias� and error due to
�variance�. Errors due to bias arise from simplifying assumptions made by
the model whereas errors due to variance occur from over-aligning the model
with the training data sets.
For any classification model, model accuracy is the primary indicator of the
goodness of the model. It is given by a total number of correct classifications
(either as the class of interest, or as not the class of interest) divided by total
number of classifications done. There are other indicators like error rate,
sensitivity, specificity, precision and recall.
For unsupervised learning (clustering), silhouette coefficient (or width) is
one of the most popular internal evaluation methods. A high value of
silhouette width indicates high intra-cluster homogeneity and inter-cluster
heterogeneity. In case, class label is known for the data set, purity is another
popular measure which evaluates the extent to which clusters contain a
single class.
Model parameter tuning is the process of adjusting the model fitting options.
For example, in the popular classification model k-Nearest Neighbour
(kNN), using different values of �k� or the number of nearest neighbours to
be considered, the model can be tuned.

The approach of combining different models with diverse strengths is known
as ensemble. Ensemble methods combine weaker learners to create stronger
ones.
One of the earliest and most popular ensemble models is bootstrap
aggregating or bagging. Bagging uses bootstrapping to generate multiple
training data sets. These training data sets are used to generate a set of
models using the same learning algorithm.
Just like bagging, boosting is another key ensemble-based technique. In
boosting, weaker learning models are trained on resampled data and the
outcomes are combined using a weighted voting approach based on the
performance of different models.
Adaptive boosting or AdaBoost is a special variant of boosting algorithm.

Basics of Feature Engineering

OBJECTIVE OF THE CHAPTER

In the last three chapters, you have been introduced to the
basic concepts of machine learning. Also, the process to
start modelling a problem has also been discussed in
details. With this context in mind, in this chapter, we will
introduce you to another very important aspect of machine
learning, that is feature engineering. Though not a core
part of the machine learning processes, feature engineering
is a critical allied task that we need to perform to make
learning more effective. It has three key components �
feature construction, feature selection, and feature
transformation, each of which will be covered in details in
this chapter.

4.1 INTRODUCTION

In the last three chapters, we had a jumpstart to the machine
learning process. We first started with what human learning is
and how the different types of machine learning emulate the
aspects of human learning. We had a detailed view of the

different types of problem that can be solved using machine
learning techniques. Before applying machine learning to
solve the problems, there are certain preparatory steps. These
preparatory steps have been covered in details. After that, we
have done a step-by-step navigation of the different activities
of modelling a problem using machine learning. Modelling
alone doesn�t help us to realize the effectiveness of
machine learning as a problem- solving tool. So we also learnt
how to measure the effectiveness of machine learning models
in solving problems. In case a specific model is not effective,
we can use different levers to boost the effectiveness. Those
levers of boosting the model performance were also covered.

Now that we are ready (well almost ready!) to start solving

problems using machine learning, we need to touch upon
another key aspect which plays a critical role in solving any
machine learning problem � feature engineering. Though
feature engineering is a part of the preparatory activities which
have already been covered in Chapter 2, the criticality and
vastness of the area call for treating it separately. This area
deals with features of the data set, which form an important
input of any machine learning problem � be supervised or
unsupervised learning. Feature engineering is a critical
preparatory process in machine learning. It is responsible for
taking raw input data and converting that to well-aligned
features which are ready to be used by the machine learning
models.

But before we start discussing feature engineering, let�s try

to understand more clearly what feature is.

Did you know?

Unstructured data is raw, unorganized data which doesn�t
follow a specific format or hierarchy. Typical examples of
unstructured data include text data from social networks,
e.g. Twitter, Facebook, etc. or data from server logs, etc.

4.1.1 What is a feature?

A feature is an attribute of a data set that is used in a machine
learning process. There is a view amongst certain machine
learning practitioners that only those attributes which are
meaningful to a machine learning problem are to be called as
features, but this view has to be taken with a pinch of salt. In
fact, selection of the subset of features which are meaningful
for machine learning is a sub-area of feature engineering
which draws a lot of research interest. The features in a data
set are also called its dimensions. So a data set having �n�
features is called an n-dimensional data set.

Let�s take the example of a famous machine learning data

set, Iris, introduced by the British statistician and biologist
Ronald Fisher, partly shown in Figure 4.1. It has five attributes
or features namely Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length,
Petal. Width and Species. Out of these, the feature �Species�
represent the class variable and the remaining features are the
predictor variables. It is a five-dimensional data set.

FIG. 4.1 Data set features

4.1.2 What is feature engineering?

Feature engineering refers to the process of translating a data
set into features such that these features are able to represent
the data set more effectively and result in a better learning
performance.

As we know already, feature engineering is an important
pre-processing step for machine learning. It has two major
elements:

1. feature transformation
2. feature subset selection

Feature transformation transforms the data � structured or
unstructured, into a new set of features which can represent the
underlying problem which machine learning is trying to solve.
There are two variants of feature transformation:

1. feature construction
2. feature extraction

Both are sometimes known as feature discovery.

Feature construction process discovers missing information
about the relationships between features and augments the
feature space by creating additional features. Hence, if there
are �n� features or dimensions in a data set, after feature
construction �m� more features or dimensions may get added.
So at the end, the data set will become �n + m� dimensional.

Feature extraction is the process of extracting or creating a
new set of features from the original set of features using some
functional mapping.

Unlike feature transformation, in case of feature subset

selection (or simply feature selection) no new feature is
generated. The objective of feature selection is to derive a
subset of features from the full feature set which is most
meaningful in the context of a specific machine learning
problem. So, essentially the job of feature selection is to derive
a subset F  (F , F , �, F ) of F  (F , F , �, F ), where m < n,
i
such that F  is most meaningful and gets the best result for a
machine learning problem. We will discuss these concepts in
detail in the next section.

Points to Ponder

Data scientists and machine learning practitioners spend
significant amount of time in different feature engineering
activities. Selecting the right features has a critical role to
play in the success of a machine learning model.

It is quite evident that feature construction expands the
feature space, while feature extraction and feature selection
reduces the feature space.

4.2 FEATURE TRANSFORMATION

Engineering a good feature space is a crucial prerequisite for
the success of any machine learning model. However, often it
is not clear which feature is more important. For that reason,
all available attributes of the data set are used as features and
the problem of identifying the important features is left to the
learning model. This is definitely not a feasible approach,
particularly for certain domains e.g. medical image
classification, text categorization, etc. In case a model has to
be trained to classify a document as spam or non-spam, we can
represent a document as a bag of words. Then the feature
space will contain all unique words occurring across all
documents. This will easily be a feature space of a few
hundred thousand features. If we start including bigrams or
trigrams along with words, the count of features will run in
millions. To deal with this problem, feature transformation
comes into play. Feature transformation is used as an effective
tool for dimensionality reduction and hence for boosting
learning model performance. Broadly, there are two distinct
goals of feature transformation:

Achieving best reconstruction of the original features in the data set
Achieving highest efficiency in the learning task

Did you know?

In the field of natural language processing, �n-gram� is a
contiguous set of n items for example words in a text block
or document. Using numerical prefixes, n-gram of size 1 is
called unigram (i.e. a single word), size 2 is called bigram
(i.e. a two-word phrase), size 3 is called trigram (i.e. a
three-word phrase) etc.

4.2.1 Feature construction

Feature construction involves transforming a given set of input
features to generate a new set of more powerful features. To
understand more clearly, let�s take the example of a real estate
data set having details of all apartments sold in a specific
region.

The data set has three features � apartment length,

apartment breadth, and price of the apartment. If it is used as
an input to a regression problem, such data can be training data
for the regression model. So given the training data, the model
should be able to predict the price of an apartment whose price
is not known or which has just come up for sale. However,
instead of using length and breadth of the apartment as a
predictor, it is much convenient and makes more sense to use
the area of the apartment, which is not an existing feature of
the data set. So such a feature, namely apartment area, can be
added to the data set. In other words, we transform the three-
dimensional data set to a four-dimensional data set, with the
newly �discovered� feature apartment area being added to the
original data set. This is depicted in Figure 4.2.

FIG. 4.2 Feature construction (example 1)

Note: Though for the sake of simplicity the features

apartment length and apartment breadth have been retained in
Figure 4.2, in reality, it makes more sense to exclude these
features when building the model.

There are certain situations where feature construction is an
essential activity before we can start with the machine learning
task. These situations are

when features have categorical value and machine learning needs numeric
value inputs
when features having numeric (continuous) values and need to be converted
to ordinal values
when text-specific feature construction needs to be done

4.2.1.1 Encoding categorical (nominal) variables

Let�s take the example of another data set on athletes, as
presented in Figure 4.3a. Say the data set has features age, city
of origin, parents athlete (i.e. indicate whether any one of the
parents was an athlete) and Chance of Win. The feature chance
of a win is a class variable while the others are predictor
variables. We know that any machine learning algorithm,
whether it�s a classification algorithm (like kNN) or a
regression algorithm, requires numerical figures to learn from.
So there are three features � City of origin, Parents athlete, and

Chance of win, which are categorical in nature and cannot be
used by any machine learning task.

In this case, feature construction can be used to create new

dummy features which are usable by machine learning
algorithms. Since the feature �City of origin� has three unique
values namely City A, City B, and City C, three dummy
features namely origin_ city_A, origin_city_B, and
origin_city_C is created. In the same way, dummy features
parents_athlete_Y and parents_athlete_N are created for
feature �Parents athlete� and win_chance_Y and
win_chance_N are created for feature �Chance of win�. The
dummy features have value 0 or 1 based on the categorical
value for the original feature in that row. For example, the
second row had a categorical value �City B� for the feature
�City of origin�. So, the newly created features in place of
�City of origin�, i.e. origin_city_A, origin_city_B and
origin_city_C will have values 0, 1 and 0, respectively. In the
same way, parents_athlete_Y and parents_athlete_N will have
values 0 and 1, respectively in row 2 as the original feature
�Parents athlete� had a categorical value �No� in row 2. The
entire set of transformation for athletes� data set is shown in
Figure 4.3b.

FIG. 4.3 Feature construction (encoding nominal variables)

However, examining closely, we see that the features
�Parents athlete� and �Chance of win� in the original data set
can have two values only. So creating two features from them
is a kind of duplication, since the value of one feature can be
decided from the value of the other. To avoid this duplication,
we can just leave one feature and eliminate the other, as shown
in Figure 4.3c.

4.2.1.2 Encoding categorical (ordinal) variables

Let�s take an example of a student data set. Let�s assume that
there are three variable � science marks, maths marks and
grade as shown in Figure 4.4a. As we can see, the grade is an
ordinal variable with values A, B, C, and D. To transform this
variable to a numeric variable, we can create a feature
num_grade mapping a numeric value against each ordinal
value. In the context of the current example, grades A, B, C,
and D in Figure 4.4a is mapped to values 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the
transformed variable shown in Figure 4.4b.

FIG. 4.4 Feature construction (encoding ordinal variables)

4.2.1.3 Transforming numeric (continuous) features to
categorical features

Sometimes there is a need of transforming a continuous
numerical variable into a categorical variable. For example, we
may want to treat the real estate price prediction problem,
which is a regression problem, as a real estate price category
prediction, which is a classification problem. In that case, we
can �bin� the numerical data into multiple categories based on
the data range. In the context of the real estate price prediction
example, the original data set has a numerical feature
apartment_price as shown in Figure 4.5a. It can be

transformed to a categorical variable price-grade either as
shown in Figure 4.5b or as shown in Figure 4.5c.

4.2.1.4 Text-specific feature construction

In the current world, text is arguably the most predominant
medium of communication. Whether we think about social
networks like Facebook or micro-blogging channels like
Twitter or emails or short messaging services such as
Whatsapp, text plays a major role in the flow of information.
Hence, text mining is an important area of research � not only
for technology practitioners but also for industry practitioners.
However, making sense of text data, due to the inherent
unstructured nature of the data, is not so straightforward. In the
first place, the text data chunks that we can think about do not
have readily available features, like structured data sets, on
which machine learning tasks can be executed. All machine
learning models need numerical data as input. So the text data
in the data sets need to be transformed into numerical features.

FIG. 4.5 Feature construction (numeric to categorical)

Text data, or corpus which is the more popular keyword, is
converted to a numerical representation following a process is
known as vectorization. In this process, word occurrences in
all documents belonging to the corpus are consolidated in the
form of bag-of-words. There are three major steps that are
followed:

1. tokenize
2. count
3. normalize

In order to tokenize a corpus, the blank spaces and

punctuations are used as delimiters to separate out the words,
or tokens. Then the number of occurrences of each token is
counted, for each document. Lastly, tokens are weighted with

reducing importance when they occur in the majority of the
documents. A matrix is then formed with each token
representing a column and a specific document of the corpus
representing each row. Each cell contains the count of
occurrence of the token in a specific document. This matrix is
known as a document-term matrix (also known as a term-
document matrix). Figure 4.6 represents a typical document-
term matrix which forms an input to a machine learning
model.

FIG. 4.6 Feature construction (text-specific)

4.2.2 Feature extraction

In feature extraction, new features are created from a
combination of original features. Some of the commonly used
operators for combining the original features include

1. For Boolean features: Conjunctions, Disjunctions, Negation, etc.
2. For nominal features: Cartesian product, M of N, etc.
3. For numerical features: Min, Max, Addition, Subtraction,

Multiplication, Division, Average, Equivalence, Inequality, etc.

Let�s take an example and try to understand. Say, we have a

data set with a feature set F  (F , F , �, F ). After feature
1
extraction using a mapping function f (F , F , �, F ) say, we

n

2

i

1

2

n

will have a set of features

 such that

and m  <  n. For  example,

. This is depicted in

Figure 4.7.

FIG. 4.7 Feature extraction

Let�s discuss the most popular feature extraction algorithms

used in machine learning:

4.2.2.1 Principal Component Analysis

Every data set, as we have seen, has multiple attributes or
dimensions � many of which might have similarity with each
other. For example, the height and weight of a person, in
general, are quite related. If the height is more, generally
weight is more and vice versa. So if a data set has height and
weight as two of the attributes, obviously they are expected to
be having quite a bit of similarity. In general, any machine
learning algorithm performs better as the number of related
attributes or features reduced. In other words, a key to the

success of machine learning lies in the fact that the features are
less in number as well as the similarity between each other is
very less. This is the main guiding philosophy of principal
component analysis (PCA) technique of feature extraction.

In PCA, a new set of features are extracted from the original

features which are quite dissimilar in nature. So an n-
dimensional feature space gets transformed to an m-
dimensional feature space, where the dimensions are
orthogonal to each other, i.e. completely independent of each
other. To understand the concept of orthogonality, we have to
step back and do a bit of dip dive into vector space concept in
linear algebra.

We all know that a vector is a quantity having both

magnitude and direction and hence can determine the position
of a point relative to another point in the Euclidean space (i.e.
a two or three or �n� dimensional space). A vector space is a
set of vectors. Vector spaces have a property that they can be
represented as a linear combination of a smaller set of vectors,
called basis vectors. So, any vector �v� in a vector space can be
represented as

where, a  represents �n� scalars and u  represents the basis

i

i

vectors. Basis vectors are orthogonal to each other.
Orthogonality of vectors in n-dimensional vector space can be
thought of an extension of the vectors being perpendicular in a
two-dimensional vector space. Two orthogonal vectors are
completely unrelated or independent of each other. So the
transformation of a set of vectors to the corresponding set of

basis vectors such that each vector in the original set can be
expressed as a linear combination of basis vectors helps in
decomposing the vectors to a number of independent
components.

Now, let�s extend this notion to the feature space of a data
set. The feature vector can be transformed to a vector space of
the basis vectors which are termed as principal components.
These principal components, just like the basis vectors, are
orthogonal to each other. So a set of feature vectors which may
have similarity with each other is transformed to a set of
principal components which are completely unrelated.
However, the principal components capture the variability of
the original feature space. Also, the number of principal
component derived, much like the basis vectors, is much
smaller than the original set of features.

The objective of PCA is to make the transformation in such

a way that

1. The new features are distinct, i.e. the covariance between the new

features, i.e. the principal components is 0.

2. The principal components are generated in order of the variability in the

data that it captures. Hence, the first principal component should
capture the maximum variability, the second principal component
should capture the next highest variability etc.

3. The sum of variance of the new features or the principal components

should be equal to the sum of variance of the original features.

PCA works based on a process called eigenvalue

decomposition of a covariance matrix of a data set. Below are
the steps to be followed:

1. First, calculate the covariance matrix of a data set.
2. Then, calculate the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.
3. The eigenvector having highest eigenvalue represents the direction in
which there is the highest variance. So this will help in identifying the

first principal component.

4. The eigenvector having the next highest eigenvalue represents the

direction in which data has the highest remaining variance and also
orthogonal to the first direction. So this helps in identifying the second
principal component.

5. Like this, identify the top �k� eigenvectors having top �k� eigenvalues so

as to get the �k� principal components.

4.2.2.2 Singular value decomposition

Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization
technique commonly used in linear algebra. SVD of a matrix
A (m � n) is a factorization of the form:

where, U and V are orthonormal matrices, U is an m � m
unitary matrix, V is an n � n unitary matrix and ? is an m � n
rectangular diagonal matrix. The diagonal entries of ? are
known as singular values of matrix A. The columns of U and
V are called the left-singular and right-singular vectors of
matrix A, respectively.

SVD is generally used in PCA, once the mean of each

variable has been removed. Since it is not always advisable to
remove the mean of a data attribute, especially when the data
set is sparse (as in case of text data), SVD is a good choice for
dimensionality reduction in those situations.

SVD of a data matrix is expected to have the properties

highlighted below:

1. Patterns in the attributes are captured by the right-singular vectors, i.e.

the columns of V.

2. Patterns among the instances are captured by the left-singular, i.e. the

columns of U.

3. Larger a singular value, larger is the part of the matrix A that it accounts

for and its associated vectors.

4. New data matrix with �k� attributes is obtained using the equation

?

D  = D � [v , v , � , v ]
k
1

2

Thus, the dimensionality gets reduced to k
SVD is often used in the context of text data.

4.2.2.3 Linear Discriminant Analysis

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is another commonly used
feature extraction technique like PCA or SVD. The objective
of LDA is similar to the sense that it intends to transform a
data set into a lower dimensional feature space. However,
unlike PCA, the focus of LDA is not to capture the data set
variability. Instead, LDA focuses on class separability, i.e.
separating the features based on class separability so as to
avoid over-fitting of the machine learning model.

Unlike PCA that calculates eigenvalues of the covariance

matrix of the data set, LDA calculates eigenvalues and
eigenvectors within a class and inter-class scatter matrices.
Below are the steps to be followed:

1. Calculate the mean vectors for the individual classes.
2. Calculate intra-class and inter-class scatter matrices.
3. Calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors for S

-1

W
the intra-class scatter matrix and S  is the inter-class scatter matrix

W

B

 and S , where S  is

B

where, m  is the mean vector of the i-th class

i

where, mi is the sample mean for each class, m is the overall mean of
the data set, Ni is the sample size of each class

4. Identify the top �k� eigenvectors having top �k� eigenvalues

4.3 FEATURE SUBSET SELECTION

Feature selection is arguably the most critical pre-processing
activity in any machine learning project. It intends to select a
subset of system attributes or features which makes a most
meaningful contribution in a machine learning activity. Let�s
quickly discuss a practical example to understand the
philosophy behind feature selection. Say we are trying to
predict the weight of students based on past information about
similar students, which is captured in a �student weight� data
set. The student weight data set has features such as Roll
Number, Age, Height, and Weight. We can well understand
that roll number can have no bearing, whatsoever, in
predicting student weight. So we can eliminate the feature roll
number and build a feature subset to be considered in this
machine learning problem. The subset of features is expected
to give better results than the full set. The same has been
depicted in Figure 4.8.

FIG. 4.8 Feature selection

But before we go forward with more detailed discussion on
feature selection, let�s try to understand the issues which have

made feature selection such a relevant problem to be solved.

4.3.1 Issues in high-dimensional data

With the rapid innovations in the digital space, the volume of
data generated has increased to an unbelievable extent. At the
same time, breakthroughs in the storage technology area have
made storage of large quantity of data quite cheap. This has
further motivated the storage and mining of very large and
high-dimensionality data sets.

Points to Ponder

�High-dimensional� refers to the high number of variables
or attributes or features present in certain data sets, more
so in the domains like DNA analysis, geographic
information systems (GIS), social networking, etc. The
high-dimensional spaces often have hundreds or thousands
of dimensions or attributes, e.g. DNA microarray data can
have up to 450,000 variables (gene probes).

Alongside, two new application domains have seen drastic

development. One is that of biomedical research, which
includes gene selection from microarray data. The other one is
text categorization which deals with huge volumes of text data
from social networking sites, emails, etc. The first domain, i.e.
biomedical research generates data sets having a number of
features in the range of a few tens of thousands. The text data
generated from different sources also have extremely high
dimensions. In a large document corpus having few thousand
documents embedded, the number of unique word tokens

which represent the feature of the text data set, can also be in
the range of a few tens of thousands. To get insight from such
high-dimensional data may be a big challenge for any machine
learning algorithm. On one hand, very high quantity of
computational resources and high amount of time will be
required. On the other hand the performance of the model �
both for supervised and unsupervised machine learning task,
also degrades sharply due to unnecessary noise in the data.
Also, a model built on an extremely high number of features
may be very difficult to understand. For this reason, it is
necessary to take a subset of the features instead of the full set.

The objective of feature selection is three-fold:

Having faster and more cost-effective (i.e. less need for computational
resources) learning model
Improving the efficiency of the learning model
Having a better understanding of the underlying model that generated the
data

4.3.2 Key drivers of feature selection � feature relevance
and redundancy

4.3.2.1 Feature relevance

In supervised learning, the input data set which is the training
data set, has a class label attached. A model is inducted based
on the training data set � so that the inducted model can assign
class labels to new, unlabelled data. Each of the predictor
variables, is expected to contribute information to decide the
value of the class label. In case a variable is not contributing
any information, it is said to be irrelevant. In case the
information contribution for prediction is very little, the
variable is said to be weakly relevant. Remaining variables,
which make a significant contribution to the prediction task
are said to be strongly relevant variables.

In unsupervised learning, there is no training data set or
labelled data. Grouping of similar data instances are done and
similarity of data instances are evaluated based on the value of
different variables. Certain variables do not contribute any
useful information for deciding the similarity of dissimilarity
of data instances. Hence, those variables make no significant
information contribution in the grouping process. These
variables are marked as irrelevant variables in the context of
the unsupervised machine learning task.

To get a perspective, we can think of the simple example of
the student data set that we discussed at the beginning of this
section. Roll number of a student doesn�t contribute any
significant information in predicting what the Weight of a
student would be. Similarly, if we are trying to group together
students with similar academic capabilities, Roll number can
really not contribute any information whatsoever. So, in
context of the supervised task of predicting student Weight or
the unsupervised task of grouping students with similar
academic merit, the variable Roll number is quite irrelevant.

Any feature which is irrelevant in the context of a machine
learning task is a candidate for rejection when we are selecting
a subset of features. We can consider whether the weakly
relevant features are to be rejected or not on a case-to-case
basis.

4.3.2.2 Feature redundancy

A feature may contribute information which is similar to the
information contributed by one or more other features. For
example, in the weight prediction problem referred earlier in
the section, both the features Age and Height contribute
similar information. This is because with an increase in Age,

Weight is expected to increase. Similarly, with the increase of
Height also Weight is expected to increase. Also, Age and
Height increase with each other. So, in context of the Weight
prediction problem, Age and Height contribute similar
information. In other words, irrespective of whether the feature
height is present as a part of the feature subset, the learning
model will give almost same results. In the same way, without
age being part of the predictor variables, the outcome of the
learning model will be more or less same. In this kind of a
situation when one feature is similar to another feature, the
feature is said to be potentially redundant in the context of the
learning problem.

All features having potential redundancy are candidates for

rejection in the final feature subset. Only a small number of
representative features out of a set of potentially redundant
features are considered for being a part of the final feature
subset.

So, in a nutshell, the main objective of feature selection is to

remove all features which are irrelevant and take a
representative subset of the features which are potentially
redundant. This leads to a meaningful feature subset in context
of a specific learning task.

Now, the question is how to find out which of the features
are irrelevant or which features have potential redundancy. For
that multiple measures are being used, some of which have
been covered in the next sub-section.

4.3.3 Measures of feature relevance and redundancy

4.3.3.1 Measures of feature relevance

As mentioned earlier, feature relevance is to be gauged by the
amount of information contributed by a feature. For supervised
learning, mutual information is considered as a good measure
of information contribution of a feature to decide the value of
the class label. That�s why it is a good indicator of the
relevance of a feature with respect to the class variable. Higher
the value of mutual information of a feature, more relevant is
that feature. Mutual information can be calculated as follows:

MI(C, f ) = H(C) + H( f ) - H(C, f )

where, marginal entropy of the class, H(C) =

marginal entropy of the feature �x�, H( f ) =

and K = number of classes, C = class variable, f = feature set

that take discrete values.

In case of unsupervised learning, there is no class variable.
Hence, feature-to-class mutual information cannot be used to
measure the information contribution of the features. In case of
unsupervised learning, the entropy of the set of features
without one feature at a time is calculated for all the features.
Then, the features are ranked in a descending order of

information gain from a feature and top �?� percentage (value
of �?� is a design parameter of the algorithm) of features are
selected as relevant features. The entropy of a feature f is
calculated using Shannon�s formula below:

 is used only for features that take discrete values. For

continuous features, it should be replaced by discretization
performed first to estimate probabilities p(f = x).

4.3.3.2 Measures of Feature redundancy

Feature redundancy, as we have already discussed, is based on
similar information contribution by multiple features. There
are multiple measures of similarity of information
contribution, salient ones being

1. Correlation-based measures
2. Distance-based measures, and
3. Other coefficient-based measure

1. Correlation-based similarity measure

Correlation is a measure of linear dependency between two
random variables. Pearson�s product moment correlation
coefficient is one of the most popular and accepted measures
of correlation between two random variables. For two random
feature variables F  and F , Pearson correlation coefficient is
defined as:

2

1

Correlation values range between +1 and �1. A correlation
of 1 (+ / �) indicates perfect correlation, i.e. the two features
having a perfect linear relationship. In case the correlation is 0,
then the features seem to have no linear relationship.
Generally, for all feature selection problems, a threshold value
is adopted to decide whether two features have adequate
similarity or not.

2. Distance-based similarity measure

The most common distance measure is the Euclidean
distance, which, between two features F  and F  are
calculated as:

2

1

2

1

where F  and F  are features of an n-dimensional data set.
Refer to the Figure 4.9. The data set has two features, aptitude
(F ) and communication (F ) under consideration. The
2
Euclidean distance between the features has been calculated
using the formula provided above.

1

FIG. 4.9 Distance calculation between features

A more generalized form of the Euclidean distance is the

Minkowski distance, measured as

Minkowski distance takes the form of Euclidean distance

(also called L  norm) when r = 2.

2

At r = 1, it takes the form of Manhattan distance (also

called L  norm), as shown below:

1

A specific example of Manhattan distance, used more
frequently to calculate the distance between binary vectors is
the Hamming distance. For example, the Hamming distance

between two vectors 01101011 and 11001001 is 3, as
illustrated in Figure 4.10a.

3. Other similarity measures

Jaccard index/coefficient is used as a measure of similarity
between two features. The Jaccard distance, a measure of
dissimilarity between two features, is complementary of
Jaccard index.

FIG. 4.10 Distance measures between features

For two features having binary values, Jaccard index is

measured as

where, n  = number of cases where both the features have

11

value 1

n  = number of cases where the feature 1 has value 0 and
01

feature 2 has value 1

n  = number of cases where the feature 1 has value 1 and
10

feature 2 has value 0

Jaccard distance, d  = 1 - J

Let�s consider two features F  and F  having values (0, 1, 1,
1
0, 1, 0, 1, 0) and (1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0). Figure 4.10b shows the
identification of the values of n , n  and n . As shown, the
cases where both the values are 0 have been left out without
border � as an indication of the fact that they will be excluded
in the calculation of Jaccard coefficient.

Simple matching coefficient (SMC) is almost same as
Jaccard coeficient except the fact that it includes a number of
cases where both the features have a value of 0.

value 1

n  = number of cases where the feature 1 has value 0 and
01
feature 2 has value 1

n  = number of cases where the feature 1 has value 1 and
10
feature 2 has value 0

n  = number of cases where both the features have value 0

Quite understandably, the total count of rows, n = n + n
+ n + n . As shown in Figure 4.10c, all values have been
included in the calculation of SMC.

01

One more measure of similarity using similarity coefficient
calculation is Cosine Similarity. Let�s take the example of a
typical text classification problem. The text corpus needs to be
first transformed into features with a word token being a
feature and the number of times the word occurs in a
document comes as a value in each row. There are thousands
of features in such a text data set. However, the data set is
sparse in nature as only a few words do appear in a document,
and hence in a row of the data set. So each row has very few
non-zero values. However, the non-zero values can be
anything integer value as the same word may occur any
number of times. Also, considering the sparsity of the data set,
the 0-0 matches (which obviously is going to be pretty high)
need to be ignored. Cosine similarity which is one of the most
popular measures in text classification is calculated as:

where, x.y = vector dot product of x and y =

Let�s calculate the cosine similarity of x and y, where x = (2,

4, 0, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0) and y = (2, 1, 0, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1).

In this case, x.y = 2*2 + 4*1 + 0*0 + 0*0 + 2*3 + 1*2 + 3*1 +
0*0 + 0*1 = 19

Cosine similarity actually measures the angle (refer to Fig.
4.11) between x and y vectors. Hence, if cosine similarity has a
value 1, the angle between x and y is 0� which means x and y
are same except for the magnitude. If cosine similarity is 0, the
angle between x and y is 90�. Hence, they do not share any
similarity (in case of text data, no term/word is common). In
the above example, the angle comes to be 43.2�.

FIG. 4.11 Cosine similarity

4.3.4 Overall feature selection process

Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of features
in a data set. As depicted in Figure 4.12, a typical feature
selection process consists of four steps:

1. generation of possible subsets
2. subset evaluation
3. stop searching based on some stopping criterion
4. validation of the result

FIG. 4.12 Feature selection process

Subset generation, which is the first step of any feature
selection algorithm, is a search procedure which ideally should
produce all possible candidate subsets. However, for an n-
dimensional data set, 2  subsets can be generated. So, as the
value of �n� becomes high, finding an optimal subset from all
the 2  candidate subsets becomes intractable. For that reason,

n

n

different approximate search strategies are employed to find
candidate subsets for evaluation. On one hand, the search may
start with an empty set and keep adding features. This search
strategy is termed as a sequential forward selection. On the
other hand, a search may start with a full set and successively
remove features. This strategy is termed as sequential
backward elimination. In certain cases, search start with both
ends and add and remove features simultaneously. This
strategy is termed as a bi-directional selection.

Each candidate subset is then evaluated and compared with

the previous best performing subset based on certain
evaluation criterion. If the new subset performs better, it
replaces the previous one.

This cycle of subset generation and evaluation continues till
a pre-defined stopping criterion is fulfilled. Some commonly
used stopping criteria are

1. the search completes
2. some given bound (e.g. a specified number of iterations) is reached
3. subsequent addition (or deletion) of the feature is not producing a better

subset

4. a sufficiently good subset (e.g. a subset having better classification

accuracy than the existing benchmark) is selected

Then the selected best subset is validated either against
prior benchmarks or by experiments using real-life or synthetic
but authentic data sets. In case of supervised learning, the
accuracy of the learning model may be the performance
parameter considered for validation. The accuracy of the
model using the subset derived is compared against the model
accuracy of the subset derived using some other benchmark
algorithm. In case of unsupervised, the cluster quality may be
the parameter for validation.

4.3.5 Feature selection approaches

There are four types of approach for feature selection:

1. Filter approach
2. Wrapper approach
3. Hybrid approach
4. Embedded approach

In the filter approach (as depicted in Fig. 4.13), the feature
subset is selected based on statistical measures done to assess
the merits of the features from the data perspective. No
learning algorithm is employed to evaluate the goodness of the
feature selected. Some of the common statistical tests
conducted on features as a part of filter approach are �
Pearson�s correlation, information gain, Fisher score, analysis
of variance (ANOVA), Chi-Square, etc.

FIG. 4.13 Filter approach

In the wrapper approach (as depicted in Fig. 4.14),

identification of best feature subset is done using the induction
algorithm as a black box. The feature selection algorithm
searches for a good feature subset using the induction
algorithm itself as a part of the evaluation function. Since for
every candidate subset, the learning model is trained and the
result is evaluated by running the learning algorithm, wrapper
approach is computationally very expensive. However, the
performance is generally superior compared to filter approach.

FIG. 4.14 Wrapper approach

Hybrid approach takes the advantage of both filter and
wrapper approaches. A typical hybrid algorithm makes use of
both the statistical tests as used in filter approach to decide the
best subsets for a given cardinality and a learning algorithm to
select the final best subset among the best subsets across
different cardinalities.

Embedded approach (as depicted in Fig. 4.15) is quite

similar to wrapper approach as it also uses and inductive
algorithm to evaluate the generated feature subsets. However,
the difference is it performs feature selection and classification
simultaneously.

FIG. 4.15 Embedded approach

4.4 SUMMARY

A feature is an attribute of a data set that is used in a machine learning
process.
Feature engineering is an important pre-processing step for machine
learning, having two major elements:

1. feature transformation
2. feature subset selection

Feature transformation transforms data into a new set of features which can
represent the underlying machine learning problem
There are two variants of feature transformation:

1. feature construction
2. feature extraction

Feature construction process discovers missing information about the
relationships between features and augments the feature space by creating
additional features.
Feature extraction is the process of extracting or creating a new set of
features from the original set of features using some functional mapping.
Some popular feature extraction algorithms used in machine learning:

1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
2. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
3. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

Feature subset selection is intended to derive a subset of features from the
full feature set. No new feature is generated.
The objective of feature selection is three-fold:

1. Having faster and more cost-effective (i.e. less need for

computational resources) learning model

2. Improving the efficiency of the learning model
3. Having a better understanding of the underlying model that

generated the data
Feature  selection  intends  to  remove  all  features  which  are
irrelevant and take a representative subset of the features which
are  potentially  redundant.  This  leads  to  a  meaningful  feature
subset in context of a specific learning task.

Feature relevance is indicated by the information gain from a feature
measured in terms of relative entropy.
Feature redundancy is based on similar information contributed by multiple
features measured by feature-to-feature:

1. Correlation
2. Distance (Minkowski distances, e.g. Manhattan, Euclidean, etc.

used as most popular measures)

3. Other coefficient-based (Jaccard, SMC, Cosine similarity, etc.)

Main approaches for feature selection are

1. Filter
2. Wrapper
3. Hybrid
4. Embedded

Brief Overview of Probability

OBJECTIVE OF THE CHAPTER

The principles of machine learning are largely dependent
on effectively handling the uncertainty in data and
predicting the outcome based on data in hand. All the
learning processes we will be discussing in later chapters
of this book expects the readers to understand the
foundational rules of probability, the concept of random
and continuous variables, distribution, and sampling
principles and few basic principles such as central limit
theorem, hypothesis testing, and Monte Carlo
approximations. As these rules, theorems, and principles
form the basis of learning principles, we will be discussing
those in this chapter with examples and illustrations.

5.1 INTRODUCTION

As we discussed in previous chapters, machine learning
provides us a set of methods that can automatically detect
patterns in data, and then can be used to uncover patterns to
predict future data, or to perform other kinds of decision

making under uncertainty. The best way to perform such
activities on top of huge data set known as big data is to use
the tools of probability theory because probability theory can
be applied to any situation involving uncertainty. In machine
learning there may be uncertainties in different forms like
arriving at the best prediction of future given the past data,
arriving at the best model based on certain data, arriving at the
confidence level while predicting the future outcome based on
past data, etc. The probabilistic approach used in machine
learning is closely related to the field of statistics, but the
emphasis is in a different direction as we see in this chapter. In
this chapter we will discuss the tools, equations, and models of
probability that are useful for machine learning domain.

5.2 IMPORTANCE OF STATISTICAL TOOLS IN MACHINE LEARNING

In machine learning, we train the system by using a limited
data set called �training data� and based on the confidence
level of the training data we expect the machine learning
algorithm to depict the behaviour of the larger set of actual
data. If we have observation on a subset of events, called
�sample�, then there will be some uncertainty in attributing the
sample results to the whole set or population. So, the question
was how a limited knowledge of a sample set can be used to
predict the behaviour of a real set with some confidence. It
was realized by mathematicians that even if some knowledge
is based on a sample, if we know the amount of uncertainty
related to it, then it can be used in an optimum way without
causing loss of knowledge. Refer Figure 5.1

FIG. 5.1 Knowledge and uncertainty

Probability theory provides a mathematical foundation for

quantifying this uncertainty of the knowledge. As the
knowledge about the training data comes in the form of
interdependent feature sets, the conditional probability
theories (especially the Bayes theorem), discussed later in this
chapter form the basis for deriving required confidence level
of the training data.

Different distribution principles discussed in this chapter
create the view of how the data set that we will be dealing with
in machine learning can behave, in terms of their feature
distributions. It is important to understand the mathematical
function behind each of these distributions so that we can
understand how the data is spread out from its average value �
denoted by the mean and the variance. While choosing the
samples from these distribution sets we should be able to
calculate to what extent the sample is representing the actual
behaviour of the full data set. These along with the test of
hypothesis principles build the basis for finding out the
uncertainty in the training data set to represent the actual data
set which is the fundamental principle of machine learning.

5.3 CONCEPT OF PROBABILITY � FREQUENTIST AND BAYESIAN
INTERPRETATION

The concept of probability is not new. In our day to day life,
we use the concept of probability in many places. For
example, when we talk about probabilities of getting the heads
and the tails when a coin is flipped are equal, we actually
intend to say that if a coin is flipped many times, the coin will
land heads a same number of times as it lands tails. This is the
frequentist interpretation of probability. This interpretation
represents the long run frequencies of events. Another
important interpretation of probability tries to quantify the
uncertainty of some event and thus focuses on information

rather than repeated trials. This is called the Bayesian
interpretation of probability. Taking the same example of coin
flipping is interpreted as � the coin is equally likely to land
heads or tails when we flip the coin next.

The reason the Bayesian interpretation can be used to model
the uncertainty of events is that it does not expect the long run
frequencies of the events to happen. For example, if we have
to compute the probability of Brazil winning 2018 football
world cup final, that event can happen only once and can�t be
repeated over and over again to calculate its probability. But
still, we should be able to quantify the uncertainty about the
event and which is only possible if we interpret probability the
Bayesian way. To give some more machine learning oriented
examples, we are starting a new software implementation
project for a large customer and want to compute the
probability of this project getting into customer escalation
based on data from similar projects in the past, or we want to
compute the probability of a tumor to be malignant or not
based on the probability distribution of such cases among the
patients of similar profile. In all these cases it is not possible to
do a repeated trial of the event and the Bayesian concept is
valid for computing the uncertainty. So, in this book, we will
focus on the Bayesian interpretation to develop our machine
learning models. The basic formulae of probability remain the
same anyway irrespective of whatever interpretation we adopt.

5.3.1 A brief review of probability theory

We will briefly touch upon the basic probability theory in this
section just as a refresher so that we can move to the building
blocks of machine learning way of use of probability. As
discussed in previous chapters, the basic concept of machine
learning is that we want to have a limited set of �Training� data

that we use as a representative of a large set of Actual data and
through probability distribution we try to find out how an
event which is matching with the training data can represent
the outcome with some confidence.

5.3.1.1 Foundation rules

We will review the basic rules of probability in this section.

Let us introduce few notations that will be used throughout

this book.

p(A) denotes the probability that the event A is true. For
example, A might be the logical statement �Brazil is going to
win the next football world cup final�. The expression 0 ? p(A)
? 1 denotes that the probability of this event happening lies
between 0 and 1, where p(A) = 0 means the event will
definitely not happen, and p(A) = 1 means the event will
definitely happen. The notation p(A?) denotes the probability of
the event not A; this is defined as p(A?) = 1 ? p(A). It is also
common practice to write A = 1 to mean the event A is true,
and A = 0 to mean the event A is false. So, this is a binary
event where the event is either true or false but can�t be
something indefinite.

The probability of selecting an event A, from a sample size

of X is defined as

p(A) =

, where n is the number of times the instance of

event A is present in the sample of size X.

5.3.1.2 Probability of a union of two events

Two events A and B are called mutually exclusive if they can�t
happen together. For example, England winning the Football
World Cup 2018 and Brazil winning the Football World Cup
2018 are two mutually exclusive events and can�t happen
together. For any two events, A and B, we define the
probability of A or B as

5.3.1.3 Joint probabilities

The probability of the joint event A and B is defined as the
product rule:

where p(A|B) is defined as the conditional probability of
event A happening if event B happens. Based on this joint
distribution on two events p(A, B),we can define the
marginal distribution as follows:

summing up the all probable states of B gives the total
probability formulae, which is also called sum rule or the
rule of total probability.

Same way, p(B) can be defined as

This formula can be extended for the countably infinite
number of events in the set and chain rule of probability can
be derived if the product rule is applied multiple times as

5.3.1.4 Conditional probability

We define the conditional probability of event A, given that
event B is true, as follows:

where, p(A, B) is the joint probability of A and B and can

also be denoted as p(A ? B)

Similarly,

Illustration. In a toy-making shop, the automated machine

produces few defective pieces. It is observed that in a lot of
1,000 toy parts, 25 are defective. If two random samples are
selected for testing without replacement (meaning that the first
sample is not put back to the lot and thus the second sample is
selected from the lot size of 999) from the lot, calculate the
probability that both the samples are defective.

Solution: Let A denote the probability of first part being
defective and B denote the second part being defective. Here,
we have to employ the conditional probability of the second
part being found defective when the first part is already found
defective.

By law of probability, p(A) =

As we are selecting the second sample without replacing the

first sample into the lot and the first one is already found
defective, there are now 24 defective pieces out of 999 pieces
left in the lot.

which is the probability of both the parts being found

defective.

5.3.1.5 Bayes rule

The Bayes rule, also known as Bayes Theorem, can be
derived by combining the definition of conditional probability
with the product and sum rules, as below:

Illustration: Flagging an email as spam based on the
sender name of the email

Let�s take an example to identify the probability of an email to
be really spam based on the name of the sender. We often
receive email from mail id containing junk characters or words
such as bulk, mass etc. which turn out to be a spam mail. So,
we want our machine learning agent to flag the spam emails
for us so that we can easily delete them.

Let�s also assume that we have knowledge about the
reliability of the assumption that emails with sender names
�mass� and �bulk� are spam email is 80% meaning that if some
email has sender name with �mass� or �bulk� then the email
will be spam with probability 0.8. The probability of false
alarm is 10% meaning that the agent will show the positive
result as spam even if the email is not a spam with a
probability 0.1. Also, we have a prior knowledge that only
0.4% of the total emails received are spam.

Solution:

Let x be the event of the flag being set as spam because the
sender name has the words �mass� or �bulk� and y be the event
of some mail really being spam.

So, p(x = 1|y = 1) = 0.8, which is the probability of the flag

being positive if the email is spam.

Many times this probability is wrongly interpreted as the
probability of an email being spam if the flag is positive. But
that is not true, because we will then ignore the prior
knowledge that only 0.4% of the emails are actually spam and
also there can be a false alarm in 10% of the cases.

So, p(y = 1) = 0.004 and p(y = 0) = 1 ? p(y = 1) = 0.996

p(x = 1 | y = 0 ) = 0 .1

Combining these terms using the Bayes rule, we can compute
the correct answer as follows:

This means that if we combine our prior knowledge with the

actual test results then there is only about a 3% chance of
emails actually being spam if the sender name contains the
terms �bulk� or �mass�. This is significantly lower than the
earlier assumption of 80% chance and thus calls for additional

checks before someone starts deleting such emails based on
only this flag.

Details of the practice application of Bayes theorem in

machine learning is discussed in Chapter 6.

5.4 RANDOM VARIABLES

Let�s take an example of tossing a coin once. We can associate
random variables X and Y as

X(H) = 1, X(T) = 0, which means this variable is associated

with the outcome of the coin facing head.

Y(H) = 0, Y(T) = 1, which means this variable is associated

with the outcome of the coin facing tails.

Here in the sample space S which is the outcome related to
tossing the coin once, random variables represent the single-
valued real function [X(?)] that assigns a real number, called
its value to each sample point of S. A random variable is not a
variable but is a function. The sample space S is called the
domain of random variable X and the collection of all the
numbers, i.e. values of X(?), is termed the range of the random
variable.

We can define the event (X = x) where x is a fixed real

number as

(X = x) = { ?:X(?) = x }

Accordingly, we can define the following events for fixed

numbers x, x , and x :
2

1

(X ? x) = { ?:X(?) ? x }
(X > x) = { ?:X(?) > x }
(x < X ? x ) = { ?:x < X(?) ? x  }

The probabilities of these events are denoted by

P(X = x) = P{ ?:X(?) = x }
P(X ? x) = P{ ?:X(?) ? x }
P(X > x) = P{ ?:X(?) > x }
P(x < X ? x ) = P{ ?:x < X(?) ? x  }

distribution function or cumulative distribution function,
which takes the form of random variable X as

F (x ) = P(X ? x ) - ? < x < ?

Some of the important properties of F (x) are

5.4.1 Discrete random variables

Let us extend the concept of binary events by defining a
discrete random variable X. Let X be a random variable with
cdf F (x) and it changes values only in jumps (a countable
number of them) and remains constant between the jumps then

x

it is called a discrete random variable. So, the definition of a
discrete random variable is that its range or the set X contains a
finite or countably infinite number of points.

Let us consider that the jumps of F (x) of the discrete

x

 where this
random variable X is occurring at points x x x
sequence represents a finite or countably infinite set and x  <x
j
if i < j. See Figure 5.2.

1, 2, 3�.,

i

We can denote this through notation as

The probability of the event that X = x is denoted as p(X =

x), or just p(x) for short. p is called a probability mass
function (pmf).

FIG. 5.2 A discrete random variable X with cdf F (x) = p(X ? x) for x = 0, 1, 2, 3,

Refer to Figure 5.3, the pmf is defined on a finite state
space X = {1, 2, 3, 4} that shows a uniform distribution with

p(x ) =  . This distribution means that X is always equal to the

value  , in other words, it is a constant.

DISCUSSION POINTS

Discuss few examples of discrete random variables in
practical life. How do you think the behaviour is different
from the continuous random variables?

5.4.2 Continuous random variables

We have discussed the probabilities of uncertain discrete
quantities. But most of the real-life events are continuous in
nature. For example, if we have to measure the actual time
taken to finish an activity then there can be an infinite number
of possible ways to complete the activity and thus the
measurement is continuous and not discrete as it is not similar
to the discrete event of rolling a dice or flipping a coin. Here,
the function F (x) describing the event is continuous and also

x

has a derivative

 that exists and is piecewise continuous.

The probability density function (pdf) of the continuous
random variable x is defined as

We will now see how to extend probability to reason about
uncertain continuous quantities. The probability that x lies in
any interval a ? x? b can be computed as follows.

We can define the events A = (x? a), B = (x? b), and W = (a

< x? b). We have that B = A?W, and since A and W are
mutually exclusive, according to the sum rules:

and hence,

Define the function F(q) = p(X ? q). The cumulative
distribution function (cdf) of random variable X can be
obtained by

which is a monotonically increasing function. Using this

notation, we have

using the pdf of x, we can compute the probability of the

continuous variable being in a finite interval as follows:

As the size of the interval gets smaller, it is possible to write

5.4.2.1 Mean and variance

The mean in statistical terms represents the weighted average
(often called as an expected value) of the all the possible
values of random variable X and each value is weighted by its
probability. It is denoted by �  or E(X) and defined as

x

mean is one of the important parameters for a probability

distribution.

Variance of a random variable X measures the spread or
dispersion of X. If E(X) is the mean of the random variable X,
then the variance is given by

Points to Ponder:

The difference between Probability Density Function (pdf)
and the Probability Mass Function (pmf) is that the latter is
associated with the continuous random variable and the
former is associated with the discrete random variable.
While pmf represents the probability that a discrete
random variable is exactly equal to some value, the pdf
does not represent a probability by itself. The integration
of pdf over a continuous interval yields the probability.

5.5 SOME COMMON DISCRETE DISTRIBUTIONS

In this section, we will discuss some commonly used
parametric distributions defined on discrete state spaces, both
finite and countably infinite.

5.5.1 Bernoulli distributions

When we have a situation where the outcome of a trial is
withered �success� or �failure�, then the behaviour of the
random variable X can be represented by Bernoulli
distribution. Such trials or experiments are termed as Bernoulli
trials.

So we can derive that, a random variable X is called
Bernoulli random variable with parameter p when its pmf
takes the form of

Px (k) = P(X = k) = p (1 9 p )

k

1 -k

Where 0 ? p ? 1. So, using the cdf F (x) of Bernoulli

x

random variable is expressed as

The mean and variance of Bernoulli random variable X are

here, the probability of success is p and probability of
failure is 1 � p. This is obviously just a special case of a
Binomial distribution with n = 1 as we will discuss below.

5.5.2 Binomial distribution

If n independent Bernoulli trials are performed and X
represents the number of success in those n trials, then X is
called a binomial random variable. That�s the reason a
Bernoulli random variable is a special case of binomial
random variable with parameters (1, p).

The pmf of X with parameters (n, p) is given by

Where, 0 ? p ? 1 and

 is also called the binomial coefficient

which is the number of ways to choose k items from n.

For example, if we toss a coin n times. Let X ? {0, �, n}
be the number of heads. If the probability of heads is p, then
we say X has a binomial distribution, written as X ~Bin(n, p).

The corresponding cdf of x is

This distribution has the following mean and variance:

Figure 5.4 shows the binomial distribution of n = 6 and p =

0.6

FIG. 5.4 A binomial distribution of n = 6 and p = 0.6

5.5.3 The multinomial and multinoulli distributions

The binomial distribution can be used to model the outcomes
of coin tosses, or for experiments where the outcome can be
either success or failure. But to model the outcomes of tossing
a K-sided die, or for experiments where the outcome can be
multiple, we can use the multinomial distribution. This is
defined as: let x = (x , �, x ) be a random vector, where x  is
j
the number of times side j of the die occurs. Then x has the
following pmf:

K

1

where, x  + x  +�.. x  = n and

1

2

K

the multinomial coefficient is defined as

and the summation is over the set of all non-negative

integers x , x , � . x  whose sum is n.

1

2

k

Now consider a special case of n = 1, which is like rolling a

K-sided dice once, so x will be a vector of 0s and 1s (a bit
vector), in which only one bit can be turned on. This means, if
the dice shows up face k, then the k�th bit will be on. We can
consider x as being a scalar categorical random variable with K
states or values, and x is its dummy encoding with x = [?(x =
1), �,?(x = K)].

For example, if K = 3, this states that 1, 2, and 3 can be

encoded as (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1). This is also called a
one-hot encoding, as we interpret that only one of the K

�wires� is �hot� or on. This very common special case is known
as a categorical or discrete distribution and because of the
analogy with the Binomial/ Bernoulli distinction, Gustavo
Lacerda suggested that this is called the multinoulli
distribution.

5.5.4 Poisson distribution

Poisson random variable has a wide range of application as it
may be used as an approximation for binomial with parameter
(n,p) when n is large and p is small and thus np is of moderate
size. An example application area is, if a fax machine has a
faulty transmission line, then the probability of receiving an
erroneous digit within a certain page transmitted can be
calculated using a Poisson random variable.

So, a random variable X is called a Poisson random variable

with parameter ? (>0) when the pmf looks like

the cdf is given as:

Figure 5.5 shows the Poisson distribution with ? = 2

FIG. 5.5 A Poisson distribution with ? = 2

5.6 SOME COMMON CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS

In this section we present some commonly used univariate
(one-dimensional) continuous probability distributions.

5.6.1 Uniform distribution

The pdf of a uniform random variable is given by:

And the cdf of X is:

See Figure 5.6 that represents a uniform distribution with a

= 3, b = 8 with increment 0.5 and repetition 20.

FIG. 5.6 A uniform distribution with a = 3, b = 8 with increment 0.5 and repetition
20

Example. If X is a continuous random variable with
X~Uniform(a,b). Find E(X). We know as per equation 5.33

This is also corroborated by the fact that because X is

uniformly distributed over the interval [a, b] we can expect the

mean to be at the middle point, E(X) =

The mean and variance of a uniform random variable X are

This is a useful distribution when we don�t have any prior
knowledge of the actual pdf and all continuous values in the
same range seems to be equally likely.

5.6.2 Gaussian (normal) distribution

The most widely used distribution in statistics and machine
learning is the Gaussian or normal distribution. Its pdf is given

by

and the corresponding cdf looks like

For easier reference a function ?(z) is defined as

Which will help us evaluate the value of F (x) which can be

x

written as

It can be derived that

Figure 5.7 shows the normal distribution graph with mean =

4, s.d. = 12.

FIG. 5.7 A normal distribution graph

For a normal random variable, mean and variance are

the notation N(?; ? ) is used to denote that p(X = x) = N(x|?;

2

2
? )

A standard normal random variable is defined as the one
whose mean is 0 and variance is 1 which means Z = N(0;1).
The plot for this is sometimes called the bell curve, (see Fig
5.8)

The Gaussian or Normal distribution is the most widely
used distribution in the study of random phenomena in nature
statistics due to few reasons:

1. It has two parameters that are easy to interpret, and which capture some

of the most basic properties of a distribution, namely its mean and
variance.

2. The central limit theorem ( Section 5.8) provides the result that sums of

independent random variables have an approximately Gaussian
distribution, which makes it a good choice for modelling residual errors
or �noise�.

3. The Gaussian distribution makes the least number of assumptions,

subject to the constraint of having a specified mean and variance and
thus is a good default choice in many cases.

4. Its simple mathematical form is easy to implement, but often highly

effective.

FIG. 5.8 A standard normal distribution graph

5.6.3 The laplace distribution

Another distribution with heavy tails is the Laplace
distribution, which is also known as the double-sided
exponential distribution. This has the following pdf:

Here ? is a location parameter and b >0 is a scale parameter.

Figure 5.9 represents the distribution of Laplace

FIG. 5.9 The distribution graph of Laplace

This puts more probability density at 0 than the Gaussian.
This property is a useful way to encourage sparsity in a model.

5.7 MULTIPLE RANDOM VARIABLES

Till now we were dealing with one random variable in a
sample space, but in most of the practical purposes there are
two or more random variables on the same sample space. We
will discuss their associated distribution and interdependence.

5.7.1 Bivariate random variables

Let us consider two random variables X and Y in the sample
space of S of a random experiment. Then the pair (X, Y) is
called s bivariate random variable or two-dimensional random
vector where each of X and Y are associated with a real
number for every element of S. The range space of bivariate
random variable (X, Y) is denoted by R  and (X, Y) can be
considered as a function that to each point ? in S assigns a
point (x, y) in the plane.

xy

(X, Y) is called a discrete bivariate random variable if the
random variables X and Y both by themselves are discrete.
Similarly, (X, Y) is called a continuous bivariate random
variable if the random variables X and Y both are continuous
and is called a mixed bivariate random variable if one of X and
Y is discrete and the other is continuous.

5.7.2 Joint distribution functions

The joint cumulative distribution function (or joint cdf) of X
and Y is defined as:

For the event (X ? x, Y ? y), we can define

A = {??S; X(?) ? x} and B = {??S; Y( ? ) ? y}

And P(A) = F (x) and P(B) = F (y)

Then, F  (x, y) = P (A ? B).

values (x , y ) for certain allowable integers I and j, then the
joint probability mass function (joint pmf) of (X, Y) is given by

cdf F  (x, y) and then the function,

is called the joint probability density function (joint pdf) of

(X, Y). Thus, integrating, we get

and Y are related in the finite space. Based on the joint pmf of
(X, Y) the conditional pmf of Y when X = x  is defined as

5.7.6 Covariance and correlation

The covariance between two random variables X and Y
measure the degree to which X and Y are (linearly) related,
which means how X varies with Y and vice versa.

So, if the variance is the measure of how a random variable

varies with itself, then the covariance is the measure of how
two random variables vary with each other.

Covariance can be between 0 and infinity. Sometimes, it is
more convenient to work with a normalized measure, because
covariance alone may not have enough information about the
relationship among the random variables. For example, let�s
define 3 different random variables based on flipping of a
coin:

Just by looking into these random variables we can

understand that they are essentially the same just a constant
multiplied at their output. But the covariance of them will be
very different when calculating with the equation 5.55:

Cov(X, Y) = 2.5, Cov(X, Z) = 25, Cov (Y, Z) = 250

To solve this problem, it is necessary to add a normalizing

term that provides this intelligence:

If Cov (X,Y) = 0, then we can say X and Y are uncorrelated.

Then from equation 5.55, X and Y are uncorrelated if

E(X, Y) = E(X)E(Y)

If X and Y are independent then it can be shown that they

are uncorrelated, but note that the converse is not true in
general.

So, we should remember

The outcomes of a Random Variable weighted by their probability is
Expectation, E(X).
The difference between Expectation of a squared Random Variable and the
2
Expectation of that Random Variable squared is Variance: E(X ) ? E(X) .
Covariance, E(XY) ? E(X)E(Y) is the same as Variance, but here two
Random Variables are compared, rather than a single Random Variable
against itself.

2

Correlation, Corr (X, Y) =

 is the Covariance

normalized.

Few important properties of correlation are

1. ?1 ? corr [X, Y] ? 1. Hence, in a correlation matrix, each entry on the

diagonal is 1, and the other entries are between -1 and 1.

2. corr [X, Y] = 1 if and only if Y = aX + b for some parameters a and b,

i.e., if there is a linear relationship between X and Y.

3. From property 2 it may seem that the correlation coefficient is related to
the slope of the regression line, i.e., the coefficient a in the expression Y
= aX + b. However, the regression coefficient is in fact given by a =
cov[X, Y] /var [X]. A better way to interpret the correlation coefficient is
as a degree of linearity.

5.8 CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM

This is one of the most important theorems in probability
theory. It states that if X ,� X  is a sequence of independent
n
identically distributed random variables and each having mean

1

? and variance ?  and

2

As n ? ? (meaning for a very large but finite set) then Z
n

tends to the standard normal.

Or

where, ?(z) is the cdf of a standard normal random variable.

1

n

So, according to the central limit theorem, irrespective of
the distribution of the individual X �s the distribution of the
sum S  � X  + �X  is approximately normal for large n. This
is the very important result as whenever we need to deal with a
random variable which is the sum of a large number of random
variables than using central limit theorem we can assume that
this sum is normally distributed.

5.9 SAMPLING DISTRIBUTIONS

As we discussed earlier in this chapter, an important
application of statistics in machine learning is how to draw a
conclusion about a set or population based on the probability
model of random samples of the set. For example, based on
the malignancy sample test results of some random tumour
cases we want to estimate the proportion of all tumours which
are malignant and thus advise the doctors on the requirement
or non-requirement of biopsy on each tumour case. As we can

understand, different random samples may give different
estimates, if we can get some knowledge about the variability
of all possible estimates derived from the random samples,
then we should be able to arrive at reasonable conclusions.
Some of the terminologies used in this section are defined
below:

Population is a finite set of objects being investigated.

Random sample refers to a sample of objects drawn from a
population in a way that every member of the population has
the same chance of being chosen.

Sampling distribution refers to the probability distribution
of a random variable defined in a space of random samples.

5.9.1 Sampling with replacement

While choosing the samples from the population if each object
chosen is returned to the population before the next object is
chosen, then it is called the sampling with replacement. In this
case, repetitions are allowed. That means, if the sample size n
is chosen from the population size of N, then the number of
such samples is

N � N � cc. � N = N , because each object can be repeated.

n

Also, the probability of each sample being chosen is the

same and is

.

For example, let�s choose a random sample of 2 patients
from a population of 3 patients {A, B, C} and replacement is
allowed. There can be 9 such ordered pairs, like:

(A, A), (A, B), (A, C), (B, A), (B, B), (B, C), (C, A), (C, B), (C, C)

That means the number of random samples of 2 from the

population of 3 is

n

2

N = 3 = 9

and each of the random sample has probability

 of

being chosen.

5.9.2 Sampling without replacement

In case, we don�t return the object being chosen to the
population before choosing the next object, then the random
sample of size n is defined as the unordered subset of n objects
from the population and called sampling without replacement.
The number of such samples that can be drawn from the
population size of N is

In our previous example, the unordered sample of 2 that can
be created from the population of 3 patients when replacement
is not allowed is

(A, B), (A, C), (B, C)

Also, each of these 3 samples of size 2 has the probability of

getting chosen as

5.9.3 Mean and variance of sample

Let us consider X as a random variable with mean ? and
standard deviation ? from a population N. A random sample of
size n, drawn without replacement will generate n values x ,
1
x �..,x  for X. When samples are drawn with replacement,
2
these values are independent of each other and can be
considered as values of n independent random variables X ,
1
X ,�., X , each having mean � and variance ? . The sample
mean is a random variable ? as

2

2

n

n

As X? is a random variable, it also has a mean �  and
variance ?  and it is related to population parameters as:

?

2
?

for a large number of n, if X is approximately normally

distributed, then X? will also be normally distributed.

When the samples are drawn without replacement, then the

sample values x , x �..,x  for random variable X are not
n
independent. The sample mean X? has the mean �  and
2
variance ?  given by:
?

?

2

1

where, N is the size of the population and n < N. Also if X
is normally distributed then X? also has a normal distribution.

Now, based on the central limit theorem, if the sample size
of a random variable based on a finite population is large then
the sample mean is approximately normally distributed
irrespective of the distribution of the population. For most of
the practical applications of sampling, when the sample size is
large enough (as a rule of thumb ? 30) the sample mean is
approximately normally distributed. Also, when a random
sample is drawn from a large population, it can be assumed
that the values x , x �..,x  are independent. This assumption
of independence is one of the key to application of probability
theory in statistical inference. We use the terms like
�population is much larger than the sample size� or �population
is large compared to its sample size�, etc. to denote that the
population is large enough to make the samples independent of

n

1

2

each other. In practice, if

, then independence may

be assumed.

5.10 HYPOTHESIS TESTING

While dealing with random variables a common situation is
when we have to make certain decisions or choices based on
the observations or data which are random in nature. The
solutions for dealing with these situations is called decision
theory or hypothesis testing and it is a widely used process in
real life situations. As we discussed earlier, the key component
of machine learning is to use a sample- based training data
which can be used to represent the larger set of actual data and
it is important to estimate how confidently an outcome can be
related to the behaviour of the training data so that the
decisions on the actual data can be made. So, hypothesis
testing is an integral part of machine learning.

In terms of statistics, a hypothesis is an assumption about

1

n

the probability law of the random variables. Take, e.g. a
random sample (X ,�.. X ) of a random variable whose pdf
on parameter ? is given by f(x, ?) = f(x , x �., x ; ?). We
want to test the assumption ? = ?  against the assumption ? =
? . In this case, the assumption ? = ?  is called null hypothesis
and is denoted by H . Assumption ? = ?  is called alternate
hypothesis and is denoted by H .

A simple hypothesis is the one where all the parameters are
specified with an exact value, like H  or H  in this case. But if
the parameters don�t have an exact value, like H :? ? ?  then
H  is composite.

Concept of hypothesis testing is the decision process used
for validating a hypothesis. We can interpret a decision process
by dividing an observation space, say R into two regions � R
0
and R . If x = (x ,�..x ) are the set of observation, then if x ?
R  the decision is in favor of H and if x ? R  then the
decision is in favor of H . The region R is called acceptance
region as the null hypothesis is accepted and R  is the rejection
region. There are 4 possible decisions based on the two
regions in observation space:

3. H  is true; accept H ? this is a correct decision
4. H  is true; reject H  (which means accept H ) ? this is an incorrect

decision

So, we can see there is the possibility of 2 correct and 2

incorrect decisions and the corresponding actions. The
erroneous decisions can be termed as:

0

Type I error: reject H  (or accept H ) when H  is true. The
example of this situation is in a malignancy test of a tumour, a
benign tumour is accepted as malignant tumour and
corresponding treatment is started. This is also called Alpha
error where good is interpreted as bad.

0

1

Type II error: reject H  (or accept H ) when H  is true. The
example of this situation is in a malignancy test of a tumour, a
malignant tumour is accepted as a benign tumour and no

0

1

1

treatment for malignancy is started. This is also called Beta
error where bad is interpreted as good and can have a more
devastating impact.

The probabilities of Type I and Type II errors are

P  = P (D | H ) = P(x ? R ; H )

P = P(D | H ) = P(x ? R ; H )

II

accepting H . P  is also denoted by ? and known as level of
significance whereas P  is denoted by ? and is known as the
power of the test. Here, ? and ? are not independent of each
other as they represent the probabilities of the event from same
decision problem. So, normally a decrease in one type of error
leads to an increase in another type of when the sample size is
fixed. Though it is desirable to reduce both types of errors it is
only possible by increasing the sample size. In all practical
applications of hypothesis testing, each of the four possible
outcomes and courses of actions are associated with relative
importance or certain cost and thus the final goal can be to
reduce the overall cost.

So, the probabilities of correct decisions are

P(D | H ) = P(x ? R ; H )

P(D | H ) = P(x ? R ; H )

5.11 MONTE CARLO APPROXIMATION

Though we discussed the distribution functions of the random
variables, in practical situations it is difficult to compute them
using the change of variables formula. Monte Carlo
approximation provides a simple but powerful alternative to
this. Let�s first generate S samples from the distribution, as x1,
�, x . For these samples, we can approximate the distribution
S
of f(X) by using the empirical distribution of {f(x )}

S

s

.
s = 1

In principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any
problem which has a probabilistic interpretation. We know that
by the law of large numbers, integrals described by the
expected value of some random variable can be approximated
by taking the empirical mean (or the sample mean) of
independent samples of the random variable. A widely used
sampler is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler for
parametrizing the probability distribution of a random
variable. The main idea is to design a judicious Markov chain
model with a prescribed stationary probability distribution.
Monte Carlo techniques are now widely used in statistics and
machine learning as well. Using the Monte Carlo technique,
we can approximate the expected value of any function of a
random variable by simply drawing samples from the
population of the random variable, and then computing the
arithmetic mean of the function applied to the samples, as
follows:

This is also called Monte Carlo integration, and is easier to

evaluate than the numerical integration which attempts to
evaluate the function at a fixed grid of points. Monte Carlo

evaluates the function only in places where there is a non-
negligible probability.

For different functions f(), the approximation of some

important quantities can be obtained:

median{ x , �, x  } ? median(X)

5.12 SUMMARY

1. Frequentist interpretation of probability represents the long run

frequencies of events whereas the Bayesian interpretation of probability
tries to quantify the uncertainty of some event and thus focuses on
information rather than repeated trials.

2. According to the Bayes rule, p (A|B) = p (B|A) p(A)/ p (B).
3. A discrete random variable is expressed with the probability mass

function (pmf) p(x) = p(X = x).

4. A continuous random variable is expressed with the probability density

function (pdf) p(x) = p(X = x).

5. The cumulative distribution function (cdf) of random variable X can be

obtained by

6. The equation to find out the mean for random variable X is:

 when X is discrete

 when X is continuous.

7. The equation to find out the variance for random variable X is

8. When we have a situation where the outcome of a trial is withered

�success� or �failure�, then the behaviour of the random variable X can
be represented by Bernoulli distribution.

9. If n independent Bernoulli trials are performed and X represents the

number of success in those n trials, then X is called a binomial random
variable.

10. To model the outcomes of tossing a K-sided die, or for experiments
where the outcome can be multiple, we can use the multinomial
distribution.

11. The Poisson random variable has a wide range of application as it may
be used as an approximation for binomial with parameter (n, p) when n
is large and p is small and thus np is of moderate size.

12. Uniform distribution, Gaussian (normal) distribution, Laplace

distribution are examples for few important continuous random
distributions.

13. If there are two random variables X and Y in the sample space of S of a
random experiment, then the pair (X, Y) is called as bivariate random
variable.

14. The covariance between two random variables X and Y measures the

degree to which X and Y are (linearly) related.

15. According to the central limit theorem, irrespective of the distribution
of the individual X �s the distribution of the sum S  � X  + � X  is
approximately normal for large n.

Bayesian Concept Learning

OBJECTIVE OF THE CHAPTER:

Principles of probability for classification are an important
area of machine learning algorithms. In our practical life,
our decisions are affected by our prior knowledge or belief
about an event. Thus, an event that is otherwise very
unlikely to occur may be considered by us seriously to
occur in certain situations if we know that in the past, the
event had certainly occurred when other events were
observed. The same concept is applied in machine learning
using Bayes� theorem and the related algorithms discussed
in this chapter. The concepts of probabilities discussed in
the previous chapters are used extensively in this chapter.

In the last chapter, we discussed the rules of probability and
possible uses of probability, distribution functions, and
hypothesis testing principles in the machine learning domain.
In this chapter, we will discuss the details of the Bayesian
theorem and how it provides the basis for machine learning

concepts. The technique was derived from the work of the
18th century mathematician Thomas Bayes. He developed the
foundational mathematical principles, known as Bayesian
methods, which describe the probability of events, and more
importantly, how probabilities should be revised when there is
additional information available.

6.2 WHY BAYESIAN METHODS ARE IMPORTANT?

Bayesian learning algorithms, like the naive Bayes classifier,
are highly practical approaches to certain types of learning
problems as they can calculate explicit probabilities for
hypotheses. In many cases, they are equally competitive or
even outperform the other learning algorithms, including
decision tree and neural network algorithms.

Bayesian classifiers use a simple idea that the training data
are utilized to calculate an observed probability of each class
based on feature values. When the same classifier is used later
for unclassified data, it uses the observed probabilities to
predict the most likely class for the new features. The
application of the observations from the training data can also
be thought of as applying our prior knowledge or prior belief
to the probability of an outcome, so that it has higher
probability of meeting the actual or real-life outcome. This
simple concept is used in Bayes� rule and applied for training a
machine in machine learning terms. Some of the real-life uses
of Bayesian classifiers are as follows:

Text-based classification such as spam or junk mail filtering, author
identification, or topic categorization
Medical diagnosis such as given the presence of a set of observed symptoms
during a disease, identifying the probability of new patients having the
disease
Network security such as detecting illegal intrusion or anomaly in computer
networks

One of the strengths of Bayesian classifiers is that they

utilize all available parameters to subtly change the
predictions, while many other algorithms tend to ignore the
features that have weak effects. Bayesian classifiers assume
that even if few individual parameters have small effect on the
outcome, the collective effect of those parameters could be
quite large. For such learning tasks, the naive Bayes classifier
is most effective.

Some of the features of Bayesian learning methods that

have made them popular are as follows:

Prior knowledge of the candidate hypothesis is combined with the observed
data for arriving at the final probability of a hypothesis. So, two important
components are the prior probability of each candidate hypothesis and the
probability distribution over the observed data set for each possible
hypothesis.
The Bayesian approach to learning is more flexible than the other approaches
because each observed training pattern can influence the outcome of the
hypothesis by increasing or decreasing the estimated probability about the
hypothesis, whereas most of the other algorithms tend to eliminate a
hypothesis if that is inconsistent with the single training pattern.
Bayesian methods can perform better than the other methods while
validating the hypotheses that make probabilistic predictions. For example,
when starting a new software project, on the basis of the demographics of the
project, we can predict the probability of encountering challenges during
execution of the project.
Through the easy approach of Bayesian methods, it is possible to classify
new instances by combining the predictions of multiple hypotheses,
weighted by their respective probabilities.
In some cases, when Bayesian methods cannot compute the outcome
deterministically, they can be used to create a standard for the optimal
decision against which the performance of other methods can be measured.

As we discussed above, the success of the Bayesian method
largely depends on the availability of initial knowledge about
the probabilities of the hypothesis set. So, if these probabilities
are not known to us in advance, we have to use some
background knowledge, previous data or assumptions about
the data set, and the related probability distribution functions

to apply this method. Moreover, it normally involves high
computational cost to arrive at the optimal Bayes hypothesis.

6.3 BAYES� THEOREM

Before we discuss Bayes� theorem and its application in
concept learning, we should be clear about what is concept
learning. Let us take an example of how a child starts to learn
meaning of new words, e.g. �ball�. The child is provided with
positive examples of �objects� which are �ball�. At first, the
child may be confused with many different colours, shapes and
sizes of the balls and may also get confused with some objects
which look similar to ball, like a balloon or a globe. The
child�s parent continuously feeds her positive examples like
�that is a ball�, �this is a green ball�, �bring me that small ball�,
etc. Seldom there are negative examples used for such concept
teaching, like �this is a non-ball�, but the parent may clear the
confusion of the child when it points to a balloon and says it is
a ball by saying �that is not a ball�. But it is observed that the
learning is most influenced through positive examples rather
than through negative examples, and the expectation is that the
child will be able to identify the object �ball� from a wide
variety of objects and different types of balls kept together
once the concept of a ball is clear to her. We can extend
this example to explain how we can expect machines to learn
through the feeding of positive examples, which forms the
basis for concept learning.

To relate the above-mentioned learning concept with the
mathematical model of Bayes, we can correlate the learning
process of �meaning of a word� as equivalent to learning, a
concept using binary classification. Let us define a concept set
C and a corresponding function f(k). We also define f(k) = 1,
when k is within the set C and f(k) = 0 otherwise. Our aim is to
learn the indicator function f that defines which elements are

within the set C. So, by using the function f, we will be able to
classify the element either inside or outside our concept set. In
Bayes� theorem, we will learn how to use standard probability
calculus to determine the uncertainty about the function f, and
we can validate the classification by feeding positive
examples.

There are few notations that will be introduced before going

into the details of Bayes� theorem. In Chapter 5, we already
discussed Bayes� probability rule as given below:

where A and B are conditionally related events and p(A|B)
denotes the probability of event A occurring when event B has
already occurred.

Let us assume that we have a training data set D where we
have noted some observed data. Our task is to determine the
best hypothesis in space H by using the knowledge of D.

6.3.1 Prior

The prior knowledge or belief about the probabilities of
various hypotheses in H is called Prior in context of Bayes�
theorem. For example, if we have to determine whether a
particular type of tumour is malignant for a patient, the prior
knowledge of such tumours becoming malignant can be used
to validate our current hypothesis and is a prior probability or
simply called Prior.

Let us introduce few notations to explain the concepts. We
will assume that P(h) is the initial probability of a hypothesis
�h� that the patient has a malignant tumour based only on the
malignancy test, without considering the prior knowledge of
the correctness of the test process or the so-called training
data. Similarly, P(T) is the prior probability that the training
data will be observed or, in this case, the probability of
positive malignancy test results. We will denote P(T|h) as the
probability of observing data T in a space where �h� holds true,
which means the probability of the test results showing a
positive value when the tumour is actually malignant.

6.3.2 Posterior

The probability that a particular hypothesis holds for a data set
based on the Prior is called the posterior probability or simply
Posterior. In the above example, the probability of the
hypothesis that the patient has a malignant tumour considering
the Prior of correctness of the malignancy test is a posterior
probability. In our notation, we will say that we are interested
in finding out P(h|T), which means whether the hypothesis
holds true given the observed training data T. This is called the
posterior probability or simply Posterior in machine learning
language. So, the prior probability P(h), which represents the
probability of the hypothesis independent of the training data
(Prior), now gets refined with the introduction of influence of
the training data as P(h|T).

According to Bayes� theorem

combines the prior and posterior probabilities together.

From the above equation, we can deduce that P(h|T)
increases as P(h) and P(T|h) increases and also as P(T)
decreases. The simple explanation is that when there is more
probability that T can occur independently of h then it is less
probable that h can get support from T in its occurrence.

It is a common question in machine learning problems to

find out the maximum probable hypothesis h from a set of
hypotheses H (h?H) given the observed training data T. This
maximally probable hypothesis is called the maximum a
posteriori (MAP) hypothesis. By using Bayes� theorem, we
can identify the MAP hypothesis from the posterior
probability of each candidate hypothesis:

and as P(T) is a constant independent of h, in this case, we

can write

6.3.3 Likelihood

In certain machine learning problems, we can further simplify
equation 6.1 if every hypothesis in H has equal probable priori
as P(h ) = P(h ), and then, we can determine P(h|T) from the
probability P(T|h) only. Thus, P(T|h) is called the likelihood of
data T given h, and any hypothesis that maximizes P(T|h) is

Concept of prior, posterior, and likelihood

Points to Ponder:

Arriving at the refined probability of an event in the light
of probability of a related event is a powerful concept and
relates very closely with our day-to-day handling of events
and using our knowledge to influence the decisions.

Example. Let us take the example of malignancy

identification in a particular patient�s tumour as an application
for Bayes rule. We will calculate how the prior knowledge of
the percentage of cancer cases in a sample population and
probability of the test result being correct influence the
probability outcome of the correct diagnosis. We have two
alternative hypotheses: (1) a particular tumour is of malignant
type and (2) a particular tumour is non-malignant type. The
priori available are�1. only 0.5% of the population has this
kind of tumour which is malignant, 2. the laboratory report has
some amount of incorrectness as it could detect the
malignancy was present only with 98% accuracy whereas
could show the malignancy was not present correctly only in
97% of cases. This means the test predicted malignancy was
present which actually was a false alarm in 2% of the cases,
and also missed detecting the real malignant tumour in 3% of
the cases.

Solution: Let us denote Malignant Tumour = MT, Positive

Lab Test = PT, Negative Lab Test = NT

h  = the particular tumour is of malignant type = MT in our
1
example

h  = the particular tumour is not malignant type = !MT in
2

our example

P(MT) = 0.005    P(!MT) = 0.995
P(PT|MT) = 0.98   P(PT|!MT) = 0.02
P(NT|!MT) = 0.97   P(NT|MT) = 0.03

So, for the new patient, if the laboratory test report shows

positive result, let us see if we should declare this as the
malignancy case or not:

As P(h |PT) is higher than P(h |PT), it is clear that the

1

2

hypothesis h  has more probability of being true. So, hMAP =
h2 = !MT.

2

This indicates that even if the posterior probability of

malignancy is significantly higher than that of non-
malignancy, the probability of this patient not having
malignancy is still higher on the basis of the prior knowledge.
Also, it should be noted that through Bayes� theorem, we
identified the probability of one hypothesis being higher than
the other hypothesis, and we did not completely accept or
reject the hypothesis by this theorem. Furthermore, there is
very high dependency on the availability of the prior data for
successful application of Bayes� theorem.

6.4 BAYES� THEOREM AND CONCEPT LEARNING

One simplistic view of concept learning can be that if we feed
the machine with the training data, then it can calculate the
posterior probability of the hypotheses and outputs the most
probable hypothesis. This is also called brute-force Bayesian
learning algorithm, and it is also observed that consistency in
providing the right probable hypothesis by this algorithm is
very comparable to the other algorithms.

6.4.1 Brute-force Bayesian algorithm

We will now discuss how to use the MAP hypothesis output to
design a simple learning algorithm called brute-force map
learning algorithm. Let us assume that the learner considers a
finite hypothesis space H in which the learner will try to learn
some target concept c:X ? {0,1} where X is the instance space
corresponding to H. The sequence of training examples is {(x ,
1
t ), (x , t ),�, (x , t )}, where x  is the instance of X and t  is
1
the target concept of x  defined as t  = c(x ). Without impacting
the efficiency of the algorithm, we can assume that the
sequence of instances of x {x ,�, x } is held fixed, and then,
1
the sequence of target values becomes T = {t ,�, t }.

For calculating the highest posterior probability, we can use

Bayes� theorem as discussed earlier in this chapter:

Calculate the posterior probability of each hypothesis h in

H:

Identify the h

MAP

 with the highest posterior probability

h
MAP

= argmax

h?H

P(h|T)

Please note that calculating the posterior probability for
each hypothesis requires a very high volume of computation,
and for a large volume of hypothesis space, this may be
difficult to achieve.

Let us try to connect the concept learning problem with the

problem of identifying the h
MAP
probability distribution of P(h) and P(T|h), we can derive the
prior knowledge of the learning task. There are few important
assumptions to be made as follows:

. On the basis of the

1. The training data or target sequence T is noise free, which means that it

is a direct function of X only (i.e. t  = c(x ))

i

i

2. The concept c lies within the hypothesis space H
3. Each hypothesis is equally probable and independent of each other

On the basis of assumption 3, we can say that each

hypothesis h within the space H has equal prior probability,
and also because of assumption 2, we can say that these prior
probabilities sum up to 1. So, we can write

P(T|h) is the probability of observing the target values t  in
the fixed set of instances {x ,�, x ) in the space where h holds
true and describes the concept c correctly. Using assumption 1
mentioned above, we can say that if T is consistent with h,

m

i

i

then the probability of data T given the hypothesis h is 1 and is
0 otherwise:

Using Bayes� theorem to identify the posterior probability

For the cases when h is inconsistent with the training data T,

using 6.5 we get

, when h is inconsistent with T,

and when h is consistent with T

Now, if we define a subset of the hypothesis H which is
consistent with T as H , then by using the total probability
equation, we get

D

This makes 6.5 as

So, with our set of assumptions about P(h) and P(T|h), we

get the posterior probability P(h|T) as

D

where H  is the number of hypotheses from the space H
which are consistent with target data set T. The interpretation
of this evaluation is that initially, each hypothesis has equal
probability and, as we introduce the training data, the posterior
probability of inconsistent hypotheses becomes zero and the
total probability that sums up to 1 is distributed equally among
the consistent hypotheses in the set. So, under this condition,

each consistent hypothesis is a MAP hypothesis with posterior

probability

.

6.4.2 Concept of consistent learners

From the above discussion, we understand the behaviour of
the general class of learner whom we call as consistent
learners. So, the group of learners who commit zero error over
the training data and output the hypothesis are called
consistent learners. If the training data is noise free and
deterministic (i.e. P(D|h) = 1 if D and h are consistent and 0
otherwise) and if there is uniform prior probability distribution
over H (so, P(h ) = P(h ) for all m, n), then every consistent
learner outputs the MAP hypothesis. An important application
of this conclusion is that Bayes� theorem can characterize the
behaviour of learning algorithms even when the algorithm
does not explicitly manipulate the probability. As it can help to
identify the optimal distributions of P(h) and P(T|h) under
which the algorithm outputs the MAP hypothesis, the
knowledge can be used to characterize the assumptions under
which the algorithms behave optimally.

m

n

Though we discussed in this section a special case of

Bayesian output which corresponds to the noise-free training
data and deterministic predictions of hypotheses where P(T|h)
takes on value of either 1 or 0, the theorem can be used with
the same effectiveness for noisy training data and additional
assumptions about the probability distribution governing the
noise.

6.4.3 Bayes optimal classifier

In this section, we will discuss the use of the MAP hypothesis
to answer the question what is the most probable classification
of the new instance given the training data. To illustrate the
concept, let us assume three hypotheses h , h , and h  in the
hypothesis space H. Let the posterior probability of these
hypotheses be 0.4, 0.3, and 0.3, respectively. There is a new
instance x, which is classified as true by h , but false by h  and
h .
3

Then the most probable classification of the new instance

(x) can be obtained by combining the predictions of all
hypotheses weighed by their corresponding posterior
probabilities. By denoting the possible classification of the
new instance as c  from the set C, the probability P(c |T) that
the correct classification for the new instance is c  is

The optimal classification is for which P(c |T) is maximum

Points to Ponder:

The approach in the Bayes optimal classifier is to calculate
the most probable classification of each new instance on

the basis of the combined predictions of all alternative
hypotheses, weighted by their posterior probabilities.

So, extending the above example,

The set of possible outcomes for the new instance x is

within the set C = {True, False} and

P(h  | T) = 0.4, P(False | h ) = 0, P(True | h ) = 1
P(h  | T) = 0.3, P(False | h ) = 1, P(True | h ) = 0
P(h  | T) = 0.3, P(False | h ) = 1, P(True | h ) = 0

Then,

and

This method maximizes the probability that the new
instance is classified correctly when the available training
data, hypothesis space and the prior probabilities of the
hypotheses are known. This is thus also called Bayes optimal
classifier.

6.4.4 Na�ve Bayes classifier

Na�ve Bayes is a simple technique for building classifiers:
models that assign class labels to problem instances. The basic
idea of Bayes rule is that the outcome of a hypothesis can be
predicted on the basis of some evidence (E) that can be
observed.

From Bayes rule, we observed that

1. A prior probability of hypothesis h or P(h): This is the probability of an

event or hypothesis before the evidence is observed.

2. A posterior probability of h or P(h|D): This is the probability of an

event after the evidence is observed within the population D.

Posterior Probability is of the format �What is the

probability that a particular object belongs to class i given
its observed feature values?�

For example, a person has height and weight of 182 cm and

68 kg, respectively. What is the probability that this person
belongs to the class �basketball player�? This can be predicted
using the Na�ve Bayes classifier. This is known as
probabilistic classifications.

In machine learning, a probabilistic classifier is a classifier
that can be foreseen, given a perception or information (input),
a likelihood calculation over a set of classes, instead of just
yielding (outputting) the most likely class that the perception
(observation) should belong to. Parameter estimation for Na�ve
Bayes models uses the method of ML.

Bayes� theorem is used when new information can be used
to revise previously determined probabilities. Depending on
the particular nature of the probability model, Na�ve Bayes
classifiers can be trained very professionally in a supervised
learning setting.

Let us see the basis of deriving the principles of Na�ve

Bayes classifiers. We take a learning task where each instance
x has some attributes and the target function (f(x)) can take any
value from the finite set of classification values C. We also
have a set of training examples for target function, and the set
of attributes {a , a ,�, a } for the new instance are known to
us. Our task is to predict the classification of the new instance.

According to the approach in Bayes� theorem, the

classification of the new instance is performed by assigning

the two terms P(a , a , c, a |c ) and P(ci). In a practical
n i
scenario, it is possible to calculate P(ci) by calculating the
frequency of each target value c  in the training data set. But
the P(a , a , c, a |c ) cannot be estimated easily and needs a
very high effort of calculation. The reason is that the number
of these terms is equal to the product of number of possible
instances and the number of possible target values, and thus,
each instance in the instance space needs to be visited many
times to arrive at the estimate of the occurrence. Thus, the
Na�ve Bayes classifier makes a simple assumption that the
attribute values are conditionally independent of each other for
the target value. So, applying this simplification, we can now
say that for a target value of an instance, the probability of
observing the combination a ,a ,�, a  is the product of
probabilities of individual attributes P(a |c ).

Then, from equation 6.7, we get the approach for the Na�ve

Bayes classifier as

Here, we will be able to compute P(a |c ) as we have to
calculate this only for the number of distinct attributes values
(a ) times the number of distinct target values (c ), which is
much smaller set than the product of both the sets. The most

important reason for the popularity of the Na�ve Bayes
classifier approach is that it is not required to search the whole
hypothesis space for this algorithm, but rather we can arrive at
the target classifier by simply counting the frequencies of
various data combinations within the training example.

To summarize, a Na�ve Bayes classifier is a primary
probabilistic classifier based on a view of applying Bayes�
theorem (from Bayesian inference with strong naive)
independence assumptions. The prior probabilities in Bayes�
theorem that are changed with the help of newly available
information are classified as posterior probabilities.

A key benefit of the naive Bayes classifier is that it requires

only a little bit of training information (data) to gauge the
parameters (mean and differences of the variables) essential
for the classification (arrangement). In the Na�ve Bayes
classifier, independent variables are always assumed, and only
the changes (variances) of the factors/variables for each class
should be determined and not the whole covariance matrix.
Because of the rather na�ve assumption that all features of the
dataset are equally important and independent, this is called
Na�ve Bayes classifier.

Na�ve Bayes classifiers are direct linear classifiers that are
known for being the straightforward, yet extremely proficient
result. The modified version of Na�ve Bayes classifier
originates from the assumption that information collection
(data set) is commonly autonomous (mutually independent). In
most of the practical scenarios, the �independence� assumption
is regularly violated. However, Na�ve Bayes classifiers still
tend to perform exceptionally well.

Some of the key strengths and weaknesses of Na�ve Bayes

classifiers are described in Table 6.1.

Table 6.1 Strengths and Weaknesses of Bayes Classifiers

Example. Let us assume that we want to predict the outcome of a football

world cup match on the basis of the past performance data of the playing
teams. We have training data available (refer Fig. 6.3) for actual match
outcome, while four parameters are considered � Weather Condition (Rainy,
Overcast, or Sunny), how many matches won were by this team out of the last
three matches (one match, two matches, or three matches), Humidity
Condition (High or Normal), and whether they won the toss (True or False).
Using Na�ve Bayesian, you need to classify the conditions when this team
wins and then predict the probability of this team winning a particular match
when Weather Conditions = Rainy, they won two of the last three matches,
Humidity = Normal and they won the toss in the particular match.

FIG. 6.3 Training data for the Na�ve Bayesian method

6.4.4.1 Na�ve Bayes classifier steps

Step 1: First construct a frequency table. A frequency table is drawn for each
attribute against the target outcome. For example, in Figure 6.3, the various
attributes are (1) Weather Condition, (2) How many matches won by this team
in last three matches, (3) Humidity Condition, and (4) whether they won the
toss and the target outcome is will they win the match or not?

Step 2: Identify the cumulative probability for �Won match = Yes� and the
probability for �Won match = No� on the basis of all the attributes. Otherwise,
simply multiply probabilities of all favourable conditions to derive �YES�
condition. Multiply probabilities of all non-favourable conditions to derive
�No� condition.

Step 3: Calculate probability through normalization by applying the below
formula

P(Yes) will give the overall probability of favourable

condition in the given scenario.

P(No) will give the overall probability of non-favourable

condition in the given scenario.

Solving the above problem with Naive Bayes

Step 1: Construct a frequency table. The posterior probability can be easily
derived by constructing a frequency table for each attribute against the target.
For example, frequency of Weather Condition variable with values �Sunny�
when the target value Won match is �Yes�, is, 3/(3+4+2) = 3/9.

Figure 6.4 shows the frequency table thus constructed.

Step 2:

To predict whether the team will win for given weather conditions (a ) =
Rainy, Wins in last three matches (a ) = 2 wins, Humidity (a ) = Normal and
2
Win toss (a ) = True, we need to choose �Yes� from the above table for the
given conditions.

From Bayes� theorem, we get

This equation becomes much easier to resolve if we recall that Na�ve Bayes
classifier assumes independence among events. This is specifically true for
class-conditional independence, which means that the events are independent
so long as they are conditioned on the same class value. Also, we know that if

Conclusion: This shows that there is 58% probability that the team will win if
the above conditions become true for that particular day. Thus, Na�ve Bayes
classifier provides a simple yet powerful way to consider the influence of
multiple attributes on the target outcome and refine the uncertainty of the
event on the basis of the prior knowledge because it is able to simplify the
calculation through independence assumption.

6.4.5 Applications of Na�ve Bayes classifier

Text classification: Na�ve Bayes classifier is among the most
successful known algorithms for learning to classify text
documents. It classifies the document where the probability of
classifying the text is more. It uses the above algorithm to
check the permutation and combination of the probability of
classifying a document under a particular �Title�. It has various
applications in document categorization, language detection,
and sentiment detection, which are very useful for traditional
retailers, e-retailors, and other businesses on judging the
sentiments of their clients on the basis of keywords in
feedback forms, social media comments, etc.

Spam filtering: Spam filtering is the best known use of Na�ve
Bayesian text classification. Presently, almost all the email
providers have this as a built-in functionality, which makes use
of a Na�ve Bayes classifier to identify spam email on the basis
of certain conditions and also the probability of classifying an
email as �Spam�. Na�ve Bayesian spam sifting has turned into
a mainstream mechanism to recognize illegitimate a spam
email from an honest-to-goodness email (sometimes called
�ham�). Users can also install separate email filtering
programmes. Server-side email filters such as DSPAM, Spam
Assassin, Spam Bayes, and ASSP make use of Bayesian spam
filtering techniques, and the functionality is sometimes
embedded within the mail server software itself.

Hybrid Recommender System: It uses Na�ve Bayes classifier
and collaborative filtering. Recommender systems (used by e-
retailors like eBay, Alibaba, Target, Flipkart, etc.) apply
machine learning and data mining techniques for filtering
unseen information and can predict whether a user would like
a given resource. For example, when we log in to these retailer
websites, on the basis of the usage of texts used by the login
and the historical data of purchase, it automatically
recommends the product for the particular login persona. One
of the algorithms is combining a Na�ve Bayes classification
approach with collaborative filtering, and experimental results
show that this algorithm provides better performance
regarding accuracy and coverage than other algorithms.

Online Sentiment Analysis: The online applications use
supervised machine learning (Na�ve Bayes) and useful
computing. In the case of sentiment analysis, let us assume
there are three sentiments such as nice, nasty, or neutral, and
Na�ve Bayes classifier is used to distinguish between them.
Simple emotion modelling combines a statistically based

classifier with a dynamical model. The Na�ve Bayes classifier
employs �single words� and �word pairs� like features and
determines the sentiments of the users. It allocates user
utterances into nice, nasty, and neutral classes, labelled as +1,
?1, and 0, respectively. This binary output drives a simple
first-order dynamical system, whose emotional state represents
the simulated emotional state of the experiment�s
personification.

6.4.6 Handling Continuous Numeric Features in Na�ve
Bayes Classifier

In the above example, we saw that the Na�ve Bayes classifier
model uses a frequency table of the training data for its
calculation. Thus, each attribute data should be categorical in
nature so that the combination of class and feature values can
be created. But this is not possible in the case of continuous
numeric data as it does not have the categories of data.

The workaround that is applied in these cases is discretizing

the continuous data on the basis of some data range. This is
also called binning as the individual categories are termed as
bins. For example, let us assume we want to market a certain
credit card to all the customers who are visiting a particular
bank. We have to classify the persons who are visiting a bank
as either interested candidate for taking a new card or non-
interested candidate for a new card, and on the basis of this
classification, the representative will approach the customer
for sale. In this case, the customers visit the bank continuously
during banking hours and have different values for the
attributes we want to evaluate before classifying them into the
interested/non-interested categories.

If we plot the number of customers visiting the bank during

the 8 hours of banking time, the distribution graph will be a
continuous graph. But if we introduce a logic to categorize the
customers according to their time of entering the bank, then
we will be able to put the customers in �bins� or buckets for
our analysis. We can then try to assess what time range is best
suited for targeting the customers who will have interest in the
new credit card. The bins created by categorizing the
customers by their time of entry looks like Figure 6.5.

This creates eight natural bins for us (or we may change the

number of bins by changing our categorizing criteria), which
can now be used for Bayes analysis.

FIG. 6.5 The distribution of bins based on the time of entry of customers in the
bank

We must have noted that a significant assumption in the Na�ve
Bayes classifier was that the attribute values a , a ,�, a  are
conditionally independent for a target value. The Na�ve Bayes
classifier generates optimal output when this condition is met.
Though this assumption significantly reduces the complexity
of computation, in many practical scenarios, this requirement
of conditional independence becomes a difficult constraint for
the application of this algorithm. So, in this section, we will
discuss the approach of Bayesian Belief network, which
assumes that within the set of attributes, the probability
distribution can have conditional probability relationship as
well as conditional independence assumptions. This is
different from the Na�ve Bayes assumption of conditional
independence of all the attributes as the belief network
provides the flexibility of declaring a subset of the attributes as
conditionally dependent while leaving rest of the attributes to
hold the assumptions of conditional independence. The prior
knowledge or belief about the influence of one attribute over
the other is handled through joint probabilities as discussed
later in this section.

Let us refresh our mind on the concept of conditional

probability. If an uncertain event A is conditional on a
knowledge or belief K, then the degree of belief in A with the
assumption that K is known is expressed as P(A|K).
Traditionally, conditional probability is expressed by joint
probability as follows:

Rearranging (6.9), we get the product rule

P(A, K) = P(A|K)P(K)

This can be extended for three variables or attributes as

P(A, K, C) = P(A|K, C)P(K, C) = P(A|K, C)P(K|C)P(C)

For a set of n attributes, the generalized form of the product

rule becomes

P(A , A , �, A ) = P(A |A , �, A )P(A |A , �, A )P(A -

This generalized version of the product rule is called the

Chain Rule.

FIG. 6.6 Chain rule

Let us understand the chain rule by using the diagram in
Figure 6.6. From the joint probability formula 6.10, we can
write

P(A, B, C, D, E) = P(A|B, C, D, E)P(B|C, D, E)P(C|D, E)P(D|E)P(E)

But from Figure 6.6, it is evident that E is not related to C
and D, which means that the probabilities of variables C and D
are not influenced by E and vice versa. Similarly, A is directly
influenced only by B. By applying this knowledge of
independence, we can simplify the above equation as

P(A, B, C, D, E) = P(A|B)P(B|C, D)P(C|D)P(D)P(E)

Let us discuss this concept of independence and conditional

independence in detail in the next section.

6.5.1 Independence and conditional independence

We represent the conditional probability of A with knowledge
of K as P(A|K). The variables A and K are said to be
independent if P(A|K) = P(A), which means that there is no
influence of K on the uncertainty of A. Similarly, the joint
probability can be written as P(A,K) = P(A)P(K).

Extending this concept, the variables A and K are said to be

conditionally independent given C if P(A|C) = P(A|K, C).

This concept of conditional independence can also be
extended to a set of attributes. We can say that the set of
variables A , A ,�, A  is conditionally independent of the set
of variables B , B ,�, B  given the set of variables C , C ,�,
C  if

If we compare this definition with our assumption in the
Na�ve Bayes classifier, we see that the Na�ve Bayes classifier
assumes that the instance attribute A  is conditionally
independent of the instance attribute A , given the target value

application of conditional independence formula as

A Bayesian Belief network describes the joint probability
distribution of a set of attributes in their joint space. In Figure
6.7, a Bayesian Belief network is presented. The diagram
consists of nodes and arcs. The nodes represent the discrete or
continuous variables for which we are interested to calculate
the conditional probabilities. The arc represents the causal
relationship of the variables.

The two important information points we get from this

network graph are used for the determining the joint
probability of the variables. First, the arcs assert that the node
variables are conditionally independent of its non-descendants
in the network given its immediate predecessors in the
network. If two variables A and B are connected through a
directed path, then B is called the descendent of A. Second, the
conditional probability table for each variable provides the
probability distribution of that variable given the values of its
immediate predecessors. We can use Bayesian probability to
calculate different behaviours of the variables in Figure 6.7.

1. The unconditional probability that Tim is late to class �

P(Tim is late to class)
=  P(Tim  late|Rain  Today)P(Rain  Today)  +  P(Tim  late|No  Rain
Today)*P(No Rain Today)
= (0.8 � 0.1) � ( 0.1 � 0.9)
= 0.17
From  this  unconditional  probability,  the  most  important  use  of  the
Bayesian  Belief  network  is  to  find  out  the  revised  probability  on  the
basis  of  the  prior  knowledge.  If  we  assume  that  there  was  rain  today,
then the probability table can quickly provide us the information about
the probability of Paul being late to class or the probability of Tim being
late  to class  from  the probability  distribution  table  itself.  But if  we do
not  know  whether  there  was  rain  today  or  not,  but  we  only  know  that
Tim  is  late  to  class  today,  then  we  can  arrive  at  the  following
probabilities �

2. The revised probability that there was rain today �

= 0.55

today)P(Rain  today)  +  P(Paul

late|No  rain

Here, we used the concept of hard evidence and soft

evidence. Hard evidence (instantiation) of a node is evidence
that the state of the variable is definitely as a particular value.
In our above example, we had hard evidence that �Tim is late
to class�. If a particular node is instantiated, then it will block
propagation of evidence further down to its child nodes. Soft
evidence for a node is the evidence that provides the prior
probability values for the node. The node �Paul is late to class�
is soft evidenced with the prior knowledge that �Tim is late to
class�.

Note

There can be two main scenarios faced in the Bayesian
Belief network learning problem. First, the network
structure might be available in advance or can be inferred
from the training data. Second, all the network variables
either are directly observable in each training example or

some of the variables may be unobservable. Learning the
conditional probability tables is a straightforward problem
when the network structure is given in advance and the
variables are fully observable in the training examples. But
in the case the network structure is available and only
some of the variable values are observable in the training
data, then the learning problem is more difficult. This is
topic of much research, and some of the advanced topics
for identifying the node values include algorithms such as
Gradient Ascent Training and the EM algorithm.

The Bayesian Belief network can represent much more

complex scenarios with dependence and independence
concepts. There are three types of connections possible in a
Bayesian Belief network.

Diverging Connection: In this type of connection, the evidence can be
transmitted between two child nodes of the same parent provided that the
parent is not instantiated. In Figure 6.7, we already saw the behaviour of
diverging connection.

Serial Connection: In this type of connection, any evidence entered at the
beginning of the connection can be transmitted through the directed path
provided that no intermediate node on the path is instantiated (see Fig. 6.8 for
illustration).

FIG. 6.8 Serial connection

Converging Connection: In this type of connection, the evidence can only be
transmitted between two parents when the child (converging) node has
received some evidence and that evidence can be soft or hard (see Fig. 6.9 for
illustration).

FIG. 6.9 Convergent connection

As discussed above, by using the Bayesian network, we
would like to infer the value of a target variable on the basis of
the observed values of some other variables. Please note that it
will not be possible to infer a single value in the case of
random variables we are dealing with, but our intention is to

infer the probability distribution of the target variable given
the observed values of other variables. In general, the
Bayesian network can be used to compute the probability
distribution of any subset of node variables given the values or
distribution of the remaining variables.

6.5.2 Use of the Bayesian Belief network in machine
learning

We have seen that the Bayesian network creates a complete
model for the variables and their relationships and thus can be
used to answer probabilistic queries about them. A common
use of the network is to find out the updated knowledge about
the state of a subset of variables, while the state of the other
subset (known as the evidence variables) is observed. This
concept, often known as probabilistic inference process of
computing the posterior distribution of variables, given some
evidences, provides a universal sufficient statistic for
applications related to detections. Thus if one wants to choose
the values for a subset of variables in order to minimize some
expected loss functions or decision errors, then this method is
quiet effective. In other words, the Bayesian network is a
mechanism for automatically applying Bayes� theorem to
complex problems. Bayesian networks are used for modelling
beliefs in domains like computational biology and
bioinformatics such as protein structure and gene regulatory
networks, medicines, forensics, document classification,
information retrieval, image processing, decision support
systems, sports betting and gaming, property market analysis
and various other fields.

6.6 SUMMARY

Bayesian methods introduced a basis for probabilistic learning methods that
consider the knowledge about the prior probabilities of alternative

hypotheses and the probability of likelihood or observing various training
data given the hypothesis. It then assigns a posterior probability to each
candidate hypothesis on the basis of the assumed priors and the observed
data.
The MAP hypothesis is the most probable hypothesis given the data. As no
other hypothesis is more likely, this is also the optimal hypothesis.
The Bayes optimal classifier calculates the most probable classification of
each new instance by combining the predictions of all alternative hypotheses,
weighted by their posterior probabilities.
Na�ve Bayes classifier makes the na�ve assumption that the attribute values
are conditionally independent given the classification of the instance. This
simplifying assumption considerably reduces the calculation overhead
without losing the effectiveness of the outcome. With this assumption in
effect, the Na�ve Bayes classifier outputs the MAP classification.
The Na�ve Bayes classifier has been found to be useful in many practical
applications and is considered as one of the powerful learning methods. Even
when the assumption of conditional independence is not met, the Na�ve
Bayes classifier is quite effective in providing a standard for the other
learning methods.
Bayesian Belief network provides the mechanism to handle more practical
scenario of considering the conditional independence of a subset of variables
while considering the joint probability distribution of the remaining variables
given the observation.

Supervised Learning: Classification

7.1 INTRODUCTION

OBJECTIVE OF THE CHAPTER :

In the last chapter on Bayesian Concept Learning, you
were introduced to an important supervised learning
algorithm � the Na�ve Bayes algorithm. As we have seen,
it is a very simple but powerful classifier based on Bayes�
theorem of conditional probability. However, other than
the Na�ve Bayes classifier, there are more algorithms for
classification. This chapter will focus on other
classification algorithms.

The first algorithm we will delve into in this chapter is

k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), which tries to classify
unlabelled data instances based on the similarity with the
labelled instances in the training data.

Then, another critical classifier, named as decision tree,

will be explained in detail. Decision tree, as the name
suggests, is a classifier based on a series of logical
decisions, which resembles a tree with branches.

Next, we will explore the random forest classifier,

which, in very simplistic terms, can be thought as a
collection of many decision trees.

Finally, a very powerful and popular classifier named

Support Vector Machine (SVM) will be explored.

So, by the end of this chapter, you will gain enough
knowledge to start solving a classification problem by
using some standard classifiers.

7.2 EXAMPLE OF SUPERVISED LEARNING

In supervised learning, the labelled training data provide the
basis for learning. According to the definition of machine
learning, this labelled training data is the experience or prior
knowledge or belief. It is called supervised learning because
the process of learning from the training data by a machine can
be related to a teacher supervising the learning process of a
student who is new to the subject. Here, the teacher is the
training data.

Training data is the past information with known value of
class field or �label�. Hence, we say that the �training data is
labelled� in the case of supervised learning (refer Fig. 7.1).
Contrary to this, there is no labelled training data for
unsupervised learning. Semi-supervised learning, as depicted
in Figure 7.1, uses a small amount of labelled data along with
unlabelled data for training.

FIG. 7.1 Supervised learning vs. unsupervised learning

In a hospital, many patients are treated in the general wards.

In comparison, the number of beds in the Intensive Care Unit
(ICU) is much less. So, it is always a cause of worry for the
hospital management that if the health condition of a number
of patients in the general ward suddenly aggravates and they
would have to be moved to ICU. Without previous planning
and preparations, such a spike in demand becomes difficult for
the hospital to manage. This problem can be addressed in a
much better way if it is possible to predict which of the
patients in the normal wards have a possibility of their health
condition deteriorating and thus need to be moved to ICU.

This kind of prediction problem comes under the purview of
supervised learning or, more specifically, under classification.
The hospital already has all past patient records. The records
of the patients whose health condition aggravated in the past
and had to be moved to ICU can form the training data for this
prediction problem. Test results of newly admitted patients are
used to classify them as high-risk or low-risk patients.

Some more examples of supervised learning are as follows:

Prediction of results of a game based on the past analysis of results

analysis of data
Price prediction in domains such as real estate, stocks, etc.

7.3 CLASSIFICATION MODEL

Let us consider two examples, say �predicting whether a
tumour is malignant or benign� and �price prediction in the
domain of real estate�. Are these two problems same in nature?

The answer is �no�. It is true that both of them are problems
related to prediction. However, for tumour prediction, we are
trying to predict which category or class, i.e. �malignant� or
�benign�, an unknown input data related to tumour belongs to.
In the other case, that is, for price prediction, we are trying to
predict an absolute value and not a class.

When we are trying to predict a categorical or nominal
variable, the problem is known as a classification problem. A
classification problem is one where the output variable is a

category such as �red� or �blue� or �malignant tumour� or
�benign tumour�, etc.

Whereas when we are trying to predict a numerical variable

such as �price�, �weight�, etc. the problem falls under the
category of regression.

Note that:

Supervised machine learning is as good as the data used to
train it. If the training data is poor in quality, the prediction
will also be far from being precise.

We can observe that in classification, the whole problem
centres around assigning a label or category or class to a test
data on the basis of the label or category or class information
that is imparted by the training data. Because the target
objective is to assign a class label, we call this type of problem
as a classification problem. Figure 7.2 depicts the typical
process of classification where a classification model is
obtained from the labelled training data by a classifier
algorithm. On the basis of the model, a class label (e.g. �Intel�
as in the case of the test data referred in Fig. 7.2) is assigned to
the test data.

A critical classification problem in the context of the

banking domain is identifying potentially fraudulent
transactions. Because there are millions of transactions which
have to be scrutinized to identify whether a particular
transaction might be a fraud transaction, it is not possible for
any human being to carry out this task. Machine learning is

leveraged efficiently to do this task, and this is a classic case
of classification. On the basis of the past transaction data,
especially the ones labelled as fraudulent, all new incoming
transactions are marked or labelled as usual or suspicious. The
suspicious transactions are subsequently segregated for a
closer review.

FIG. 7.2 Classification model

In summary, classification is a type of supervised learning

where a target feature, which is of categorical type, is
predicted for test data on the basis of the information imparted
by the training data. The target categorical feature is known as
class .

Some typical classification problems include the following:

7.4 CLASSIFICATION LEARNING STEPS

First, there is a problem which is to be solved, and then, the
required data (related to the problem, which is already stored
in the system) is evaluated and pre-processed based on the
algorithm. Algorithm selection is a critical point in supervised
learning. The result after iterative training rounds is a classifier
for the problem in hand (refer Fig. 7.3).

FIG. 7.3 Classification model steps

Problem Identification: Identifying the problem is the first
step in the supervised learning model. The problem needs to
be a well-formed problem,i.e. a problem with well-defined
goals and benefit, which has a long-term impact.

Identification of Required Data: On the basis of the problem
identified above, the required data set that precisely represents
the identified problem needs to be identified/evaluated. For
example: If the problem is to predict whether a tumour is
malignant or benign, then the corresponding patient data sets
related to malignant tumour and benign tumours are to be
identified.

Data Pre-processing: This is related to the
cleaning/transforming the data set. This step ensures that all
the unnecessary/irrelevant data elements are removed. Data
pre-processing refers to the transformations applied to the
identified data before feeding the same into the algorithm.
Because the data is gathered from different sources, it is
usually collected in a raw format and is not ready for
immediate analysis. This step ensures that the data is ready to
be fed into the machine learning algorithm.

Definition of Training Data Set: Before starting the analysis,
the user should decide what kind of data set is to be used as a
training set. In the case of signature analysis, for example, the
training data set might be a single handwritten alphabet, an
entire handwritten word (i.e. a group of the alphabets) or an
entire line of handwriting (i.e. sentences or a group of words).
Thus, a set of �input meta-objects� and corresponding �output
meta-objects� are also gathered. The training set needs to be
actively representative of the real-world use of the given
scenario. Thus, a set of data input (X) and corresponding
outputs (Y) is gathered either from human experts or
experiments.

Algorithm Selection: This involves determining the structure
of the learning function and the corresponding learning
algorithm. This is the most critical step of supervised learning
model. On the basis of various parameters, the best algorithm
for a given problem is chosen.

Training: The learning algorithm identified in the previous
step is run on the gathered training set for further fine tuning.
Some supervised learning algorithms require the user to
determine specific control parameters (which are given as
inputs to the algorithm). These parameters (inputs given to

algorithm) may also be adjusted by optimizing performance on
a subset (called as validation set) of the training set.

Evaluation with the Test Data Set: Training data is run on
the algorithm, and its performance is measured here. If a
suitable result is not obtained, further training of parameters
may be required.

7.5 COMMON CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS

Let us now delve into some common classification algorithms.
Following are the most common classification algorithms, out
of which we have already learnt about the Na�ve Bayes
classifier in Chapter 6. We will cover details of the other
algorithms in this chapter.

1. k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN)
2. Decision tree
3. Random forest
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. Na�ve Bayes classifier

7.5.1 k -Nearest Neighbour (kNN)

The kNN algorithm is a simple but extremely powerful
classification algorithm. The name of the algorithm originates
from the underlying philosophy of kNN � i.e. people having
similar background or mindset tend to stay close to each other.
In other words, neighbours in a locality have a similar
background. In the same way, as a part of the kNN algorithm,
the unknown and unlabelled data which comes for a prediction
problem is judged on the basis of the training data set elements
which are similar to the unknown element. So, the class label
of the unknown element is assigned on the basis of the class
labels of the similar training data set elements (metaphorically

can be considered as neighbours of the unknown element). Let
us try to understand the algorithm with a simple data set.

7.5.1.1 How kNN works

Let us consider a very simple Student data set as depicted in
Figure 7.4. It consists of 15 students studying in a class. Each
of the students has been assigned a score on a scale of 10 on
two performance parameters � �Aptitude� and
�Communication�. Also, a class value is assigned to each
student based on the following criteria:

1. Students having good communication skills as well as a good level of

aptitude have been classified as �Leader�

2. Students having good communication skills but not so good level of

aptitude have been classified as �Speaker�

3. Students having not so good communication skill but a good level of

aptitude have been classified as �Intel�

FIG. 7.4 Student data set

As we have already seen in Chapter 3, while building a

classification model, a part of the labelled input data is
retained as test data. The remaining portion of the input data is
used to train the model � hence known as training data. The
motivation to retain a part of the data as test data is to evaluate
the performance of the model. As we have seen, the
performance of the classification model is measured by the
number of correct classifications made by the model when
applied to an unknown data set. However, it is not possible
during model testing to know the actual label value of an
unknown data. Therefore, the test data, which is a part of the
labelled input data, is used for this purpose. If the class value
predicted for most of the test data elements matches with the
actual class value that they have, then we say that the
classification model possesses a good accuracy. In context of
the Student data set, to keep the things simple, we assume one
data element of the input data set as the test data. As depicted
in Figure 7.5, the record of the student named Josh is assumed
to be the test data. Now that we have the training data and test
data identified, we can start with the modelling.

As we have already discussed, in the kNN algorithm, the
class label of the test data elements is decided by the class
label of the training data elements which are neighbouring, i.e.
similar in nature. But there are two challenges:

1. What is the basis of this similarity or when can we say that two data

elements are similar?

2. How many similar elements should be considered for deciding the class

label of each test data element?

To answer the first question, though there are many

measures of similarity, the most common approach adopted by
kNN to measure similarity between two data elements is
Euclidean distance. Considering a very simple data set having

two features (say f  and f ), Euclidean distance between two
data elements d  and d  can be measured by

FIG. 7.5 Segregated student data set

So, as depicted in Figure 7.6, the training data points of the
Student data set considering only the features �Aptitude� and
�Communication� can be represented as dots in a two-

dimensional feature space. As shown in the figure, the training
data points having the same class value are coming close to
each other. The reason for considering two-dimensional data
space is that we are considering just the two features of the
Student data set, i.e. �Aptitude� and �Communication�, for
doing the classification. The feature �Name� is ignored
because, as we can understand, it has no role to play in
deciding the class value. The test data point for student Josh is
represented as an asterisk in the same space. To find out the
closest or nearest neighbours of the test data point, Euclidean
distance of the different dots need to be calculated from the
asterisk. Then, the class value of the closest neighbours helps
in assigning the class value of the test data element.

FIG. 7.6 2-D representation of the student data set

Now, let us try to find the answer to the second question, i.e.
how many similar elements should be considered. The answer
lies in the value of �k� which is a user-defined parameter given

as an input to the algorithm. In the kNN algorithm, the value
of �k� indicates the number of neighbours that need to be
considered. For example, if the value of k is 3, only three
nearest neighbours or three training data elements closest to
the test data element are considered. Out of the three data
elements, the class which is predominant is considered as the
class label to be assigned to the test data. In case the value of k
is 1, only the closest training data element is considered. The
class label of that data element is directly assigned to the test
data element. This is depicted in Figure 7.7.

FIG. 7.7 Distance calculation between test and training points

Let us now try to find out the outcome of the algorithm for
the Student data set we have. In other words, we want to see
what class value kNN will assign for the test data for student
Josh. Again, let us refer back to Figure 7.7. As is evident,
when the value of k is taken as 1, only one training data point
needs to be considered. The training record for student Gouri

comes as the closest one to test record of Josh, with a distance
value of 1.118. Gouri has class value �Intel�. So, the test data
point is also assigned a class label value �Intel�. When the
value of k is assumed as 3, the closest neighbours of Josh in
the training data set are Gouri, Susant, and Bobby with
distances being 1.118, 1.414, and 1.5, respectively. Gouri and
Bobby have class value �Intel�, while Susant has class value
�Leader�. In this case, the class value of Josh is decided by
majority voting. Because the class value of �Intel� is formed by
the majority of the neighbours, the class value of Josh is
assigned as �Intel�. This same process can be extended for any
value of k.

But it is often a tricky decision to decide the value of k. The

reasons are as follows:

If the value of k is very large (in the extreme case equal to the total number
of records in the training data), the class label of the majority class of the
training data set will be assigned to the test data regardless of the class labels
of the neighbours nearest to the test data.
If the value of k is very small (in the extreme case equal to 1), the class value
of a noisy data or outlier in the training data set which is the nearest
neighbour to the test data will be assigned to the test data.

The best k value is somewhere between these two extremes.

Few strategies, highlighted below, are adopted by machine

learning practitioners to arrive at a value for k.

One common practice is to set k equal to the square root of the number of
training records.
An alternative approach is to test several k values on a variety of test data
sets and choose the one that delivers the best performance.
Another interesting approach is to choose a larger value of k, but apply a
weighted voting process in which the vote of close neighbours is considered
more influential than the vote of distant neighbours.

Input: Training data set, test data set (or data points), value of

Then assign class label of the training data point to the test data point

Else

Whichever class label is predominantly present in the training data points,

End do

7.5.1.3 Why the kNN algorithm is called a lazy learner?

We have already discussed in Chapter 3 that eager learners
follow the general steps of machine learning, i.e. perform an
abstraction of the information obtained from the input data and
then follow it through by a generalization step. However, as
we have seen in the case of the kNN algorithm, these steps are
completely skipped. It stores the training data and directly
applies the philosophy of nearest neighbourhood finding to
arrive at the classification. So, for kNN, there is no learning
happening in the real sense. Therefore, kNN falls under the
category of lazy learner.

7.5.1.4 Strengths of the kNN algorithm

Extremely simple algorithm � easy to understand
Very effective in certain situations, e.g. for recommender system design
Very fast or almost no time required for the training phase

7.5.1.5 Weaknesses of the kNN algorithm

Does not learn anything in the real sense. Classification is done completely
on the basis of the training data. So, it has a heavy reliance on the training
data. If the training data does not represent the problem domain
comprehensively, the algorithm fails to make an effective classification.
Because there is no model trained in real sense and the classification is done
completely on the basis of the training data, the classification process is
very slow.
Also, a large amount of computational space is required to load the training
data for classification.

7.5.1.6 Application of the kNN algorithm

One of the most popular areas in machine learning where the
kNN algorithm is widely adopted is recommender systems. As
we know, recommender systems recommend users different
items which are similar to a particular item that the user seems
to like. The liking pattern may be revealed from past purchases
or browsing history and the similar items are identified using
the kNN algorithm.

Another area where there is widespread adoption of kNN is

searching documents/ contents similar to a given
document/content. This is a core area under information
retrieval and is known as concept search.

7.5.2 Decision tree

Decision tree learning is one of the most widely adopted
algorithms for classification. As the name indicates, it builds a
model in the form of a tree structure. Its grouping exactness is
focused with different strategies, and it is exceptionally
productive.

A decision tree is used for multi-dimensional analysis with
multiple classes. It is characterized by fast execution time and

ease in the interpretation of the rules. The goal of decision tree
learning is to create a model (based on the past data called past
vector) that predicts the value of the output variable based on
the input variables in the feature vector.

Each node (or decision node) of a decision tree corresponds
to one of the feature vector. From every node, there are edges
to children, wherein there is an edge for each of the possible
values (or range of values) of the feature associated with the
node. The tree terminates at different leaf nodes (or terminal
nodes) where each leaf node represents a possible value for the
output variable. The output variable is determined by
following a path that starts at the root and is guided by the
values of the input variables.

A decision tree is usually represented in the format depicted

in Figure 7.8.

FIG. 7.8 Decision tree structure

Each internal node (represented by boxes) tests an attribute

(represented as �A�/�B� within the boxes). Each branch
corresponds to an attribute value (T/F) in the above case. Each
leaf node assigns a classification. The first node is called as
�Root� Node. Branches from the root node are called as �Leaf�

Nodes where �A� is the Root Node (first node). �B� is the
Branch Node. �T� & �F� are Leaf Nodes.

Thus, a decision tree consists of three types of nodes:

Root Node
Branch Node
Leaf Node

Figure 7.9 shows an example decision tree for a car driving

� the decision to be taken is whether to �Keep Going� or to
�Stop�, which depends on various situations as depicted in the
figure. If the signal is RED in colour, then the car should be
stopped. If there is not enough gas (petrol) in the car, the car
should be stopped at the next available gas station.

FIG. 7.9 Decision tree example

7.5.2.1 Building a decision tree

Decision trees are built corresponding to the training data
following an approach called recursive partitioning. The

approach splits the data into multiple subsets on the basis of
the feature values. It starts from the root node, which is
nothing but the entire data set. It first selects the feature which
predicts the target class in the strongest way. The decision tree
splits the data set into multiple partitions, with data in each
partition having a distinct value for the feature based on which
the partitioning has happened. This is the first set of branches.
Likewise, the algorithm continues splitting the nodes on the
basis of the feature which helps in the best partition. This
continues till a stopping criterion is reached. The usual
stopping criteria are �

1. All or most of the examples at a particular node have the same class
2. All features have been used up in the partitioning
3. The tree has grown to a pre-defined threshold limit

Let us try to understand this in the context of an example.
Global Technology Solutions (GTS), a leading provider of IT
solutions, is coming to College of Engineering and
Management (CEM) for hiring B.Tech. students. Last year
during campus recruitment, they had shortlisted 18 students
for the final interview. Being a company of international
repute, they follow a stringent interview process to select only
the best of the students. The information related to the
interview evaluation results of shortlisted students (hiding the
names) on the basis of different evaluation parameters is
available for reference in Figure 7.10. Chandra, a student of
CEM, wants to find out if he may be offered a job in GTS. His
CGPA is quite high. His self-evaluation on the other
parameters is as follows:

Communication � Bad; Aptitude � High; Programming skills � Bad

FIG. 7.10 Training data for GTS recruitment

Let us try to solve this problem, i.e. predicting whether
Chandra will get a job offer, by using the decision tree model.
First, we need to draw the decision tree corresponding to the
training data given in Figure 7.10. According to the table, job
offer condition (i.e. the outcome) is FALSE for all the cases
where Aptitude = Low, irrespective of other conditions. So,
the feature Aptitude can be taken up as the first node of the
decision tree.

For Aptitude = High, job offer condition is TRUE for all
the cases where Communication = Good. For cases where
Communication = Bad, job offer condition is TRUE for all
the cases where CGPA = High.

Figure 7.11 depicts the complete decision tree diagram for

the table given in Figure 7.10.

FIG. 7.11 Decision tree based on the training data

7.5.2.2 Searching a decision tree

By using the above decision tree depicted in Figure 7.11, we
need to predict whether Chandra might get a job offer for the
given parameter values: CGPA = High, Communication =
Bad, Aptitude = High, Programming skills = Bad. There are
multiple ways to search through the trained decision tree for a
solution to the given prediction problem.

Exhaustive search

1. Place the item in the first group (class). Recursively examine solutions

with the item in the first group (class).

2. Place the item in the second group (class). Recursively examine

solutions with the item in the second group (class).
3. Repeat the above steps until the solution is reached.

Exhaustive search travels through the decision tree

exhaustively, but it will take much time when the decision tree
is big with multiple leaves and multiple attribute values.

Branch and bound search

Branch and bound uses an existing best solution to sidestep
searching of the entire decision tree in full. When the
algorithm starts, the best solution is well defined to have the
worst possible value; thus, any solution it finds out is an
improvement. This makes the algorithm initially run down to
the left-most branch of the tree, even though that is unlikely to
produce a realistic result. In the partitioning problem, that
solution corresponds to putting every item in one group, and it
is an unacceptable solution. A programme can speed up the
process by using a fast heuristic to find an initial solution. This
can be used as an input for branch and bound. If the heuristic
is right, the savings can be substantial.

FIG. 7.12 Decision tree based on the training data (depicting a sample path)

Figure 7.12 depicts a sample path (thick line) for the

conditions CGPA = High, Communication = Bad, Aptitude =
High and Programming skills = Bad. According to the above
decision tree, the prediction can be made as Chandra will get
the job offer.

There are many implementations of decision tree, the most

prominent ones being C5.0, CART (Classification and
Regression Tree), CHAID (Chi-square Automatic Interaction
Detector) and ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithms. The
biggest challenge of a decision tree algorithm is to find out
which feature to split upon. The main driver for identifying the
feature is that the data should be split in such a way that the
partitions created by the split should contain examples
belonging to a single class. If that happens, the partitions are
considered to be pure. Entropy is a measure of impurity of an
attribute or feature adopted by many algorithms such as ID3
and C5.0. The information gain is calculated on the basis of
the decrease in entropy (S) after a data set is split according to
a particular attribute (A). Constructing a decision tree is all
about finding an attribute that returns the highest information
gain (i.e. the most homogeneous branches).

Note:

Like information gain, there are other measures like Gini
index or chi-square for individual nodes to decide the
feature on the basis of which the split has to be applied.
The CART algorithm uses Gini index, while the CHAID
algorithm uses chi-square for deciding the feature for
applying split.

7.5.2.3 Entropy of a decision tree

Let us say S is the sample set of training examples. Then,
Entropy (S) measuring the impurity of S is defined as

where c is the number of different class labels and p refers

to the proportion of values falling into the i-th class label.

For example, with respect to the training data in Figure
7.10, we have two values for the target class �Job Offered?� �
Yes and No. The value of p  for class value �Yes� is 0.44 (i.e.
8/18) and that for class value �No� is 0.56 (i.e. 10/18). So, we
can calculate the entropy as

i

Entropy(S) = -0.44 log  (0.44) - 0.56 log  (0.56) = 0.99.

7.5.2.4 Information gain of a decision tree

The information gain is created on the basis of the decrease in
entropy (S) after a data set is split according to a particular
attribute (A). Constructing a decision tree is all about finding
an attribute that returns the highest information gain (i.e. the
most homogeneous branches). If the information gain is 0, it
means that there is no reduction in entropy due to split of the
data set according to that particular feature. On the other hand,
the maximum amount of information gain which may happen
is the entropy of the data set before the split.

Information gain for a particular feature A is calculated by

the difference in entropy before a split (or S ) with the
entropy after the split (S ).

bs

as

Information Gain (S, A) = Entropy (S ) ? Entropy (S )
as

bs

For calculating the entropy after split, entropy for all

partitions needs to be considered. Then, the weighted
summation of the entropy for each partition can be taken as the
total entropy after split. For performing weighted summation,
the proportion of examples falling into each partition is used
as weight.

Let us examine the value of information gain for the training

data set shown in Figure 7.10. We will find the value of
entropy at the beginning before any split happens and then
again after the split happens. We will compare the values for
all the cases �

1. when the feature �CGPA� is used for the split
2. when the feature �Communication� is used for the split
3. when the feature �Aptitude� is used for the split
4. when the feature �Programming Skills� is used for the split

Figure 7.13a gives the entropy values for the first level split

for each of the cases mentioned above.

As calculated, entropy of the data set before split (i.e.
Entropy (S )) = 0.99, and entropy of the data set after split
bs
(i.e. Entropy (S )) is

as

0.69 when the feature �CGPA� is used for split
0.63 when the feature �Communication� is used for split
0.52 when the feature �Aptitude� is used for split
0.95 when the feature �Programming skill� is used for split

FIG. 7.13A Entropy and information gain calculation (Level 1)

Therefore, the information gain from the feature �CGPA� =

0.99 ? 0.69 = 0.3, whereas the information gain from the
feature �Communication� = 0.99 ? 0.63 = 0.36. Likewise, the
information gain for �Aptitude� and �Programming skills� is
0.47 and 0.04, respectively.

Hence, it is quite evident that among all the features,

�Aptitude� results in the best information gain when adopted
for the split. So, at the first level, a split will be applied
according to the value of �Aptitude� or in other words,
�Aptitude� will be the first node of the decision tree formed.
One important point to be noted here is that for Aptitude =
Low, entropy is 0, which indicates that always the result will
be the same irrespective of the values of the other features.
Hence, the branch towards Aptitude = Low will not continue
any further.

As a part of level 2, we will thus have only one branch to
navigate in this case � the one for Aptitude = High. Figure
7.13b presents calculations for level 2. As can be seen from
the figure, the entropy value is as follows:

0.85 before the split
0.33 when the feature �CGPA� is used for split
0.30 when the feature �Communication� is used for split
0.80 when the feature �Programming skill� is used for split

Hence, the information gain after split with the features
CGPA, Communication and Programming Skill is 0.52, 0.55
and 0.05, respectively. Hence, the feature Communication
should be used for this split as it results in the highest
information gain. So, at the second level, a split will be
applied on the basis of the value of �Communication�. Again,
the point to be noted here is that for Communication = Good,
entropy is 0, which indicates that always the result will be the
same irrespective of the values of the other features. Hence,
the branch towards Communication = Good will not continue
any further.

FIG. 7.13B Entropy and information gain calculation (Level 2)

As a part of level 3, we will thus have only one branch to
navigate in this case � the one for Communication = Bad.
Figure 7.13c presents calculations for level 3. As can be seen
from the figure, the entropy value is as follows:

0.81 before the split
0 when the feature �CGPA� is used for split

0.50 when the feature �Programming Skill� is used for split

FIG. 7.13C Entropy and information gain calculation (Level 3)

Hence, the information gain after split with the feature
CGPA is 0.81, which is the maximum possible information
gain (as the entropy before split was 0.81). Hence, as obvious,
a split will be applied on the basis of the value of �CGPA�.
Because the maximum information gain is already achieved,
the tree will not continue any further.

7.5.2.6 Avoiding overfitting in decision tree � pruning

The decision tree algorithm, unless a stopping criterion is
applied, may keep growing indefinitely � splitting for every
feature and dividing into smaller partitions till the point that
the data is perfectly classified. This, as is quite evident, results
in overfitting problem. To prevent a decision tree getting
overfitted to the training data, pruning of the decision tree is
essential. Pruning a decision tree reduces the size of the tree

such that the model is more generalized and can classify
unknown and unlabelled data in a better way.

There are two approaches of pruning:

Pre-pruning: Stop growing the tree before it reaches perfection.
Post-pruning: Allow the tree to grow entirely and then post-prune some of
the branches from it.

In the case of pre-pruning, the tree is stopped from further
growing once it reaches a certain number of decision nodes or
decisions. Hence, in this strategy, the algorithm avoids
overfitting as well as optimizes computational cost. However,
it also stands a chance to ignore important information
contributed by a feature which was skipped, thereby resulting
in miss out of certain patterns in the data.

On the other hand, in the case of post-pruning, the tree is

allowed to grow to the full extent. Then, by using certain
pruning criterion, e.g. error rates at the nodes, the size of the
tree is reduced. This is a more effective approach in terms of
classification accuracy as it considers all minute information
available from the training data. However, the computational
cost is obviously more than that of pre-pruning.

7.5.2.7 Strengths of decision tree

It produces very simple understandable rules. For smaller trees, not much
mathematical and computational knowledge is required to understand this
model.
Works well for most of the problems.
It can handle both numerical and categorical variables.
Can work well both with small and large training data sets.
Decision trees provide a definite clue of which features are more useful for
classification.

7.5.2.8 Weaknesses of decision tree

Decision tree models are often biased towards features having more number
of possible values, i.e. levels.
This model gets overfitted or underfitted quite easily.
Decision trees are prone to errors in classification problems with many
classes and relatively small number of training examples.
A decision tree can be computationally expensive to train.
Large trees are complex to understand.

7.5.2.9 Application of decision tree

Decision tree can be applied in a data set in which there is a
finite list of attributes and each data instance stores a value for
that attribute (e.g. �High� for the attribute CGPA). When each
attribute has a small number of distinct values (e.g. �High�,
�Medium�, �Low�), it is easier/quicker for the decision tree to
suggest (or choose) an effective solution. This algorithm can
be extended to handle real-value attributes (e.g. a floating
point temperature).

The most straightforward case exists when there are only
two possible values for an attribute (Boolean classification).
Example: Communication has only two values as �Good� or
�Bad�. It is also easy to extend the decision tree to create a
target function with more than two possible output values.
Example: CGPA can take one of the values from �High�,
�Medium�, and �Low�. Irrespective of whether it is a binary
value/ multiple values, it is discrete in nature. For example,
Aptitude can take the value of either �High� or �Low�. It is not
possible to assign the value of both �High� and �Low� to the
attribute Aptitude to draw a decision tree.

There should be no infinite loops on taking a decision. As
we move from the root node to the next level node, it should
move step-by-step towards the decision node. Otherwise, the
algorithm may not give the final result for a given data. If a set

of code goes in a loop, it would repeat itself forever, unless the
system crashes.

A decision tree can be used even for some instances with

missing attributes and instances with errors in the
classification of examples or in the attribute values describing
those examples; such instances are handled well by decision
trees, thereby making them a robust learning method.

Points to Ponder

Balancing overfitting and underfitting in decision tree is a
very tricky topic, involving more of an art than science.
The way to master this art is experience in working with
more number of data sets with a lot of diversity.

7.5.3 Random forest model

Random forest is an ensemble classifier, i.e. a combining
classifier that uses and combines many decision tree
classifiers. Ensembling is usually done using the concept of
bagging with different feature sets. The reason for using large
number of trees in random forest is to train the trees enough
such that contribution from each feature comes in a number of
models. After the random forest is generated by combining the
trees, majority vote is applied to combine the output of the
different trees. A simplified random forest model is depicted in
Figure 7.14. The result from the ensemble model is usually
better than that from the individual decision tree models.

FIG. 7.14 Random forest model

7.5.3.1 How does random forest work?

The random forest algorithm works as follows:

1. If there are N variables or features in the input data set, select a subset
of �m� (m < N) features at random out of the N features. Also, the
observations or data instances should be picked randomly.

2. Use the best split principle on these �m� features to calculate the number

of nodes �d�.

3. Keep splitting the nodes to child nodes till the tree is grown to the

maximum possible extent.

4. Select a different subset of the training data �with replacement� to train
another decision tree following steps (1) to (3). Repeat this to build and
train �n� decision trees.

5. Final class assignment is done on the basis of the majority votes from

the �n� trees.

Points to Ponder

In the random forest classifier, if the number of trees is
assumed to be excessively large, the model may get
overfitted. In an extreme case of overfitting, the
model may mimic the training data, and training error
might be almost 0. However, when the model is run on an
unseen sample, it may result in a very high validation
error.

7.5.3.2 Out-of-bag (OOB) error in random forest

In random forests, we have seen, that each tree is constructed
using a different bootstrap sample from the original data. The
samples left out of the bootstrap and not used in the
construction of the i-th tree can be used to measure the
performance of the model. At the end of the run, predictions
for each such sample evaluated each time are tallied, and the
final prediction for that sample is obtained by taking a vote.
The total error rate of predictions for such samples is termed
as out-of-bag (OOB) error rate.

The error rate shown in the confusion matrix reflects the
OOB error rate. Because of this reason, the error rate displayed
is often surprisingly high.

7.5.3.3 Strengths of random forest

It runs efficiently on large and expansive data sets.
It has a robust method for estimating missing data and maintains precision
when a large proportion of the data is absent.
It has powerful techniques for balancing errors in a class population of
unbalanced data sets.

It gives estimates (or assessments) about which features are the most
important ones in the overall classification.
It generates an internal unbiased estimate (gauge) of the generalization error
as the forest generation progresses.
Generated forests can be saved for future use on other data.
Lastly, the random forest algorithm can be used to solve both classification
and regression problems.

7.5.3.4 Weaknesses of random forest

This model, because it combines a number of decision tree models, is not as
easy to understand as a decision tree model.
It is computationally much more expensive than a simple model like decision
tree.

7.5.3.5 Application of random forest

Random forest is a very powerful classifier which combines
the versatility of many decision tree models into a single
model. Because of the superior results, this ensemble model is
gaining wide adoption and popularity amongst the machine
learning practitioners to solve a wide range of classification
problems.

7.5.4 Support vector machines

SVM is a model, which can do linear classification as well as
regression. SVM is based on the concept of a surface, called a
hyperplane, which draws a boundary between data instances
plotted in the multi-dimensional feature space. The output
prediction of an SVM is one of two conceivable classes which
are already defined in the training data. In summary, the SVM
algorithm builds an N-dimensional hyperplane model that
assigns future instances into one of the two possible output
classes.

7.5.4.1 Classification using hyperplanes

In SVM, a model is built to discriminate the data instances
belonging to different classes. Let us assume for the sake of
simplicity that the data instances are linearly separable. In this
case, when mapped in a two-dimensional space, the data
instances belonging to different classes fall in different sides of
a straight line drawn in the two-dimensional space as depicted
in Figure 7.15a. If the same concept is extended to a multi-
dimensional feature space, the straight line dividing data
instances belonging to different classes transforms to a
hyperplane as depicted in Figure 7.15b.

Thus, an SVM model is a representation of the input

instances as points in the feature space, which are mapped so
that an apparent gap between them divides the instances of the
separate classes. In other words, the goal of the SVM analysis
is to find a plane, or rather a hyperplane, which separates the
instances on the basis of their classes. New examples (i.e. new
instances) are then mapped into that same space and predicted
to belong to a class on the basis of which side of the gap the
new instance will fall on. In summary, in the overall training
process, the SVM algorithm analyses input data and identifies
a surface in the multi-dimensional feature space called the
hyperplane. There may be many possible hyperplanes, and one
of the challenges with the SVM model is to find the optimal
hyperplane.

FIG. 7.15 Linearly separable data instances

Training data sets which have a substantial grouping

periphery will function well with SVM. Generalization error in
terms of SVM is the measure of how accurately and precisely
this SVM model can predict values for previously unseen data
(new data). A hard margin in terms of SVM means that an
SVM model is inflexible in classification and tries to work
exceptionally fit in the training set, thereby causing overfitting.

Support Vectors: Support vectors are the data points
(representing classes), the critical component in a data set,
which are near the identified set of lines (hyperplane). If
support vectors are removed, they will alter the position of the
dividing hyperplane.

Hyperplane and Margin: For an N-dimensional feature
space, hyperplane is a flat subspace of dimension (N?1) that
separates and classifies a set of data. For example, if we
consider a two-dimensional feature space (which is nothing
but a data set having two features and a class variable), a
hyperplane will be a one-dimensional subspace or a straight

line. In the same way, for a three-dimensional feature space
(data set having three features and a class variable),
hyperplane is a two-dimensional subspace or a simple plane.
However, quite understandably, it is difficult to visualize a
feature space greater than three dimensions, much like for a
subspace or hyperplane having more than three dimensions.

Mathematically, in a two-dimensional space, hyperplane can

be defined by the equation:

c  + c X  + c X  = 0, which is nothing but an equation of a
0

2 2

1 1
straight line.

Extending this concept to an N-dimensional space,

hyperplane can be defined by the equation:

c  + c X  + c X  + � + c X  = 0 which, in short, can be
N N
0

1 1

2 2

represented as follows:

Spontaneously, the further (or more distance) from the
hyperplane the data points lie, the more confident we can be
about correct categorization. So, when a new testing data
point/data set is added, the side of the hyperplane it lands on
will decide the class that we assign to it. The distance between
hyperplane and data points is known as margin.

7.5.4.2 Identifying the correct hyperplane in SVM

As we have already discussed, there may be multiple options
for hyperplanes dividing the data instances belonging to the
different classes. We need to identify which one will result in
the best classification. Let us examine a few scenarios before

arriving to that conclusion. For the sake of simplicity of
visualization, the hyperplanes have been shown as straight
lines in most of the diagrams.

Scenario 1

As depicted in Figure 7.16, in this scenario, we have three
hyperplanes: A, B, and C. Now, we need to identify the correct
hyperplane which better segregates the two classes represented
by the triangles and circles. As we can see, hyperplane �A� has
performed this task quite well.

FIG. 7.16 Support vector machine: Scenario 1

Scenario 2

As depicted in Figure 7.17, we have three hyperplanes: A, B,
and C. We have to identify the correct hyperplane which
classifies the triangles and circles in the best possible way.
Here, maximizing the distances between the nearest data
points of both the classes and hyperplane will help us decide
the correct hyperplane. This distance is called as margin.

In Figure 7.17b, you can see that the margin for hyperplane

A is high as compared to those for both B and C. Hence,
hyperplane A is the correct hyperplane. Another quick reason
for selecting the hyperplane with higher margin (distance) is
robustness. If we select a hyperplane having a lower margin
(distance), then there is a high probability of misclassification.

FIG. 7.17 Support vector machine: Scenario 2

Scenario 3

Use the rules as discussed in the previous section to identify
the correct hyperplane in the scenario shown in Figure 7.18.
Some of you might have selected hyperplane B as it has a
higher margin (distance from the class) than A. But, here is the
catch; SVM selects the hyperplane which classifies the classes
accurately before maximizing the margin. Here, hyperplane B
has a classification error, and A has classified all data
instances correctly. Therefore, A is the correct hyperplane.

FIG. 7.18 Support vector machine: Scenario 3

Scenario 4

In this scenario, as shown in Figure 7.19a, it is not possible to
distinctly segregate the two classes by using a straight line, as
one data instance belonging to one of the classes (triangle) lies
in the territory of the other class (circle) as an outlier.

One triangle at the other end is like an outlier for the
triangle class. SVM has a feature to ignore outliers and find
the hyperplane that has the maximum margin (hyperplane A,
as shown in Fig. 7.19b). Hence, we can say that SVM is robust
to outliers.

FIG. 7.19 Support vector machine: Scenario 4

So, by summarizing the observations from the different

scenarios, we can say that

1. The hyperplane should segregate the data instances belonging to the two

classes in the best possible way.

2. It should maximize the distances between the nearest data points of both

the classes, i.e. maximize the margin.

3. If there is a need to prioritize between higher margin and lesser

misclassification, the hyperplane should try to reduce misclassifications.

Our next focus is to find out a way to identify a hyperplane

which maximizes the margin.

7.5.4.3 Maximum margin hyperplane

Finding the Maximum Margin Hyperplane (MMH) is nothing
but identifying the hyperplane which has the largest separation
with the data instances of the two classes. Though any set of
three hyperplanes can do the correct classification, why do we
need to search for the set of hyperplanes causing the largest
separation? The answer is that doing so helps us in achieving
more generalization and hence less number of issues in the
classification of unknown data.

FIG. 7.20 Support vectors

Support vectors, as can be observed in Figure 7.20, are
data instances from the two classes which are closest to the
MMH. Quite understandably, there should be at least one
support vector from each class. The identification of support
vectors requires intense mathematical formulation, which is
out of scope of this book. However, it is fairly intuitive to
understand that modelling a problem using SVM is nothing
but identifying the support vectors and MMH corresponding to
the problem space.

Identifying the MMH for linearly separable data

Finding out the MMH is relatively straightforward for the data
that is linearly separable. In this case, an outer boundary needs
to be drawn for the data instances belonging to the different
classes. These outer boundaries are known as convex hull, as
depicted in Figure 7.21. The MMH can be drawn as the
perpendicular bisector of the shortest line (i.e. the connecting
line having the shortest length) between the convex hulls.

FIG. 7.21 Drawing the MMH for linearly separable data

We have already seen earlier that a hyperplane in the N-
dimensional feature space can be represented by the equation:

Using this equation, the objective is to find a set of values

for the vector   such that two hyperplanes, represented by the

equations below, can be specified.

This is to ensure that all the data instances that belong to
one class falls above one hyperplane and all the data instances
belonging to the other class falls below another hyperplane.
According to vector geometry, the distance of these planes

should be  . It is quite obvious that in order to maximize the

distance between hyperplanes, the value of   should be

minimized. So, in summary, the task of SVM is to solve the
optimization problem:

Identifying the MMH for non-linearly separable data

Now that we have a clear understanding of how to identify the
MMH for a linearly separable data set, let us do some study
about how non-linearly separable data needs to be handled by
SVM. For this, we have to use a slack variable ?, which
provides some soft margin for data instances in one class that
fall on the wrong side of the hyperplane. As depicted in Figure
7.22, a data instance belonging to the circle class falls on the
side of the hyperplane designated for the data instances
belonging to the triangle class. The same issue also happens
for a data instance belonging to the triangle class.

FIG. 7.22 Drawing the MMH for non-linearly separable data

A cost value �C� is imposed on all such data instances that
fall on the wrong side of the hyperplane. The task of SVM is
now to minimize the total cost due to such data instances in
order to solve the revised optimization problem:

7.5.4.4 Kernel trick

As we have seen in the last section, one way to deal with non-
linearly separable data is by using a slack variable and an
optimization function to minimize the cost value. However,
this is not the only way to use SVM to solve machine learning
problems involving non-linearly separable data sets. SVM has
a technique called the kernel trick to deal with non-linearly
separable data. As shown in Figure 7.23, these are functions
which can transform lower dimensional input space to a higher
dimensional space. In the process, it converts linearly non-

separable data to a linearly separable data. These functions are
called kernels.

FIG. 7.23 Kernel trick in SVM

Some of the common kernel functions for transforming
from a lower dimension �i� to a higher dimension �j� used by
different SVM implementations are as follows:

Linear kernel: It is in the form

Polynomial kernel: It is in the form

Sigmoid kernel: It is in the form

Gaussian RBF kernel: It is in the form

When data instances of the classes are closer to each other,
this method can be used. The effectiveness of SVM depends
both on the

selection of the kernel function
adoption of values for the kernel parameters

7.5.4.5 Strengths of SVM

SVM can be used for both classification and regression.
It is robust, i.e. not much impacted by data with noise or outliers.
The prediction results using this model are very promising.

7.5.4.6 Weaknesses of SVM

SVM is applicable only for binary classification, i.e. when there are only two
classes in the problem domain.
The SVM model is very complex � almost like a black box when it deals
with a high-dimensional data set. Hence, it is very difficult and close to
impossible to understand the model in such cases.
It is slow for a large dataset, i.e. a data set with either a large number of
features or a large number of instances.
It is quite memory-intensive.

7.5.4.7 Application of SVM

SVM is most effective when it is used for binary classification,
i.e. for solving a machine learning problem with two classes.
One common problem on which SVM can be applied is in the
field of bioinformatics � more specifically, in detecting cancer
and other genetic disorders. It can also be used in detecting the
image of a face by binary classification of images into face
and non-face components. More such applications can be
described.

7.6 SUMMARY

1. The objective of classification is to predict the class of unknown objects
on the basis of prior class-related information of similar objects. This
learning could be used when how to classify a given data is known or,
in other words, class values of data instances are available.

2. A critical classification problem in the context of the banking domain is

identifying potentially fraudulent transactions. Because there are
millions of transactions which have to be scrutinized to identify whether

a particular transaction might be a fraud transaction, it is not possible
for any human being to carry out this task.

3. Common classification algorithms are kNN, decision tree, random

forest, SVM, and Na�ve Bayes.

4. The kNN algorithm is among the best and the simplest of machine

learning algorithms. A new instance is classified by a majority vote of
its neighbours, with the instance being allocated the class that is
predominant among its kNN.

5. Decision tree learning is the most broadly utilized classifier. It is

characterized by fast execution time and ease in the interpretation of the
rules.

6. The decision tree algorithm needs to find out the attribute splitting by
which results in highest information gain. For a sample of training
examples S, entropy measures the impurity of S.

where  c  is  the  number  of  different  class  labels  and  p  refers  to  the
proportion of values falling into the i-th class label.

7. Information gain is created on the basis of the decrease in entropy (S)
after a dataset is split based on a particular attribute (A). Information
gain for a particular feature A is calculated by the difference in entropy
before a split (S ) with the entropy after the split (S ).
Information Gain (S, A) = Entropy (S ) - Entropy (S )

uses and combines many decision tree models. The result from an
ensemble model is usually better than that from one of the individual
models.

9. An SVM is a binary linear classifier. The output prediction of an SVM
is one of the two conceivable classes which are already defined in the
training data. SVM is also an example of a linear classifier and a
maximum margin classifier.

10. SVM has a new technique called the kernel trick. These are functions,

which take a lower dimensional input space and transform it to a higher
dimensional space and in the process converts a non-linearly separable
problem to a linearly separable problem. These functions are called
kernels. When all the classes are closer to each other, this method can
be used.

Supervised Learning: Regression

8.1 INTRODUCTION

OBJECTIVE OF THE CHAPTER :

In the last two chapters, you have got quite a good
conceptual overview of supervised learning algorithm for
categorical data prediction. You got a detailed
understanding of all the popular models of classification
that are used by machine learning practitioners to solve a
wide array of prediction problems where the target variable
is a categorical variable.

In this chapter, we will build concepts on prediction of

numerical variables � which is another key area of
supervised learning. This area, known as regression,
focuses on solving problems such as predicting value of
real estate, demand forecast in retail, weather forecast, etc.

First, you will be introduced to the most popular and
simplest algorithm, namely simple linear regression. This
model roots from the statistical concept of fitting a straight
line and the least squares method. We will explore this

algorithm in detail. In this same context, we will also
explore the concept of multiple linear regression.

We will then briefly touch upon the other important
algorithms in regression, namely multivariate adaptive
regression splines, logistic regression, and maximum
likelihood estimation.

By the end of this chapter, you will gain sufficient
knowledge in all the aspects of supervised learning and
become ready to start solving problems on your own.

8.2 EXAMPLE OF REGRESSION

We have mentioned many times that real estate price
prediction is a problem that can be solved by supervised
learning or, more specifically, by regression. So, what this
problem really is? Let us delve a little deeper into the problem.

New City is the primary hub of the commercial activities in

the country. In the last couple of decades, with increasing
globalization, commercial activities have intensified in New
City. Together with that, a large number of people have come
and settled in the city with a dream to achieve professional
growth in their lives. As an obvious fall-out, a large number of
housing projects have started in every nook and corner of the
city. But the demand for apartments has still outgrown the
supply. To get benefit from this boom in real estate business,
Karen has started a digital market agency for buying and
selling real estates (including apartments, independent houses,
town houses, etc.). Initially, when the business was small, she
used to interact with buyers and sellers personally and help
them arrive at a price quote � either for selling a property (for

a seller) or for buying a property (for a buyer). Her long
experience in real estate business helped her develop an
intuition on what the correct price quote of a property could be
� given the value of certain standard parameters such as area
(sq. m.) of the property, location, floor, number of years since
purchase, amenities available, etc. However, with the huge
surge in the business, she is facing a big challenge. She is not
able to manage personal interactions as well as setting the
correct price quote for the properties all alone. She hired an
assistant for managing customer interactions. But the assistant,
being new in the real estate business, is struggling with price
quotations. How can Karen solve this problem?

Fortunately, Karen has a friend, Frank, who is a data

scientist with in-depth knowledge in machine learning models.
Frank comes up with a solution to Karen�s problem. He builds
a model which can predict the correct value of a real estate if it
has certain standard inputs such as area (sq. m.) of the
property, location, floor, number of years since purchase,
amenities available, etc. Wow, that sounds to be like Karen
herself doing the job! Curious to know what model Frank has
used? Yes, you guessed it right. He used a regression model to
solve Karen�s real estate price prediction problem.

So, we just discussed about one problem which can be
solved using regression. In the same way, a bunch of other
problems related to prediction of numerical value can be
solved using the regression model. In the context of
regression, dependent variable (Y) is the one whose value is to
be predicted, e.g. the price quote of the real estate in the
context of Karen�s problem. This variable is presumed to be
functionally related to one (say, X) or more independent
variables called predictors. In the context of Karen�s problem,
Frank used area of the property, location, floor, etc. as

predictors of the model that he built. In other words, the
dependent variable depends on independent variable(s) or
predictor(s). Regression is essentially finding a relationship
(or) association between the dependent variable (Y) and the
independent variable(s) (X), i.e. to find the function �f � for the
association Y = f (X).

8.3 COMMON REGRESSION ALGORITHMS

The most common regression algorithms are

Simple linear regression
Multiple linear regression
Polynomial regression
Multivariate adaptive regression splines
Logistic regression
Maximum likelihood estimation (least squares)

8.3.1 Simple Linear Regression

As the name indicates, simple linear regression is the simplest
regression model which involves only one predictor. This
model assumes a linear relationship between the dependent
variable and the predictor variable as shown in Figure 8.1.

FIG. 8.1 Simple linear regression

In the context of Karen�s problem, if we take Price of a

Property as the dependent variable and the Area of the
Property (in sq. m.) as the predictor variable, we can build a
model using simple linear regression.

Price

Property

 = f(Area

)
Property

Assuming a linear association, we can reformulate the

model as

Price

Property

 = a + b. Area

Property

where �a� and �b� are intercept and slope of the straight line,

respectively.

Just to recall, straight lines can be defined in a slope�

intercept form Y = (a + bX), where a = intercept and b = slope
of the straight line. The value of intercept indicates the value
of Y when X = 0. It is known as �the intercept or Y intercept�
because it specifies where the straight line crosses the vertical
or Y-axis (refer to Fig. 8.1).

8.3.1.1 Slope of the simple linear regression model

Slope of a straight line represents how much the line in a graph
changes in the vertical direction (Y-axis) over a change in the
horizontal direction (X-axis) as shown in Figure 8.2.

Slope = Change in Y/Change in X

Rise is the change in Y-axis (Y ? Y ) and Run is the change

2

1

in X-axis (X  ? X ). So, slope is represented as given below:

2

1

FIG. 8.2 Rise and run representation

Example of slope

Let us find the slope of the graph where the lower point on the
line is represented as (?3, ?2) and the higher point on the line
is represented as (2, 2).

(X , Y ) = (?3, ?2) and (X , Y ) = (2, 2)

1

1

2

2

Rise = (Y  ? Y ) = (2 ? (?2)) = 2 + 2 = 4

Run = (X  ? X ) = (2 ? (?3)) = 2 + 3 = 5

2

2

1

1

Slope = Rise/Run = 4/5 = 0.8

There can be two types of slopes in a linear regression
model: positive slope and negative slope. Different types of
regression lines based on the type of slope include

Linear positive slope
Curve linear positive slope
Linear negative slope
Curve linear negative slope

Linear positive slope

A positive slope always moves upward on a graph from left to
right (refer to Fig. 8.3).

FIG. 8.3 Linear positive slope

Slope = Rise/Run = (Y  ? Y ) / (X  ? X ) = Delta (Y) / Delta(X)

2

Scenario 1 for positive slope: Delta (Y) is positive and Delta (X) is positive
Scenario 2 for positive slope: Delta (Y) is negative and Delta (X) is negative

Curve linear positive slope

FIG. 8.4 Curve linear positive slope

Curves in these graphs (refer to Fig. 8.4) slope upward from
left to right.

Slope = (Y  ? Y ) / (X  ? X ) = Delta (Y) / Delta(X)

2

1

1

2

Slope for a variable (X) may vary between two graphs, but it

will always be positive; hence, the above graphs are called as
graphs with curve linear positive slope.

Linear negative slope

A negative slope always moves downward on a graph from
left to right. As X value (on X-axis) increases, Y value
decreases (refer to Fig. 8.5).

FIG. 8.5 Linear negative slope

Slope = Rise/Run = (Y  ? Y ) / (X  ? X ) = Delta (Y) / Delta(X)

Scenario 1 for negative slope: Delta (Y) is positive and Delta (X) is negative
Scenario 2 for negative slope: Delta (Y) is negative and Delta (X) is positive

Curve linear negative slope

FIG. 8.6 Curve linear negative slope

Curves in these graphs (refer to Fig. 8.6) slope downward
from left to right.

Slope = (Y  ? Y ) / (X  ? X ) = Delta (Y) / Delta(X)

1

1

2

Slope for a variable (X) may vary between two graphs, but it
will always be negative; hence, the above graphs are called as
graphs with curve linear negative slope.

8.3.1.2 No relationship graph

Scatter graph shown in Figure 8.7 indicates �no relationship�
curve as it is very difficult to conclude whether the
relationship between X and Y is positive or negative.

FIG. 8.7 No relationship graph

8.3.1.3 Error in simple regression

The regression equation model in machine learning uses the
above slope�intercept format in algorithms. X and Y values
are provided to the machine, and it identifies the values of a
(intercept) and b (slope) by relating the values of X and Y.
However, identifying the exact match of values for a and b is
not always possible. There will be some error value (?)
associated with it. This error is called marginal or residual
error.

Y = (a + bX) + ?

Now that we have some context of the simple regression
model, let us try to explore an example to understand clearly
how to decide the parameters of the model (i.e. values of a and
b) for a given problem.

8.3.1.4 Example of simple regression

A college professor believes that if the grade for internal
examination is high in a class, the grade for external
examination will also be high. A random sample of 15
students in that class was selected, and the data is given below:

A scatter plot was drawn to explore the relationship between

the independent variable (internal marks) mapped to X-axis
and dependent variable (external marks) mapped to Y-axis as
depicted in Figure 8.8.

FIG. 8.8 Scatter plot and regression line

As you can observe from the above graph, the line (i.e. the
regression line) does not predict the data exactly (refer to Fig.
8.8). Instead, it just cuts through the data. Some predictions

are lower than expected, while some others are higher than
expected.

Residual is the distance between the predicted point (on the
regression line) and the actual point as depicted in Figure 8.9.

FIG. 8.9 Residual error

As we know, in simple linear regression, the line is drawn

using the regression formula.

Y = (a + bX) + ?

If we know the values of �a� and �b�, then it is easy to
predict the value of Y for any given X by using the above
formula. But the question is how to calculate the values of �a�
and �b� for a given set of X and Y values?

A straight line is drawn as close as possible over the points

on the scatter plot. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is the
technique used to estimate a line that will minimize the error
(?), which is the difference between the predicted and the
actual values of Y. This means summing the errors of each
prediction or, more appropriately, the Sum of the Squares of

the Errors (SSE)

It is observed that the SSE is least when b takes the value

The corresponding value of �a� calculated using the above

value of �b� is

So, let us calculate the value of a and b for the given
example. For detailed calculation, refer to Figure 8.10.

Calculation summary

Sum of X = 299

Sum of Y = 852

Mean X, M  = 19.93

X

Mean Y, M  = 56.8

Y

Sum of squares (SS ) = 226.9333

X

Sum of products (SP) = 429.8

Regression equation = ? = bX + a

a = M  ? bM  = 56.8 ? (1.89 � 19.93) = 19.0473

Y

X

? = 1.89395X + 19.0473

Hence, for the above example, the estimated regression
equation is constructed on the basis of the estimated values of
a and b:

? = 1.89395X + 19.0473

So, in the context of the given problem, we can say

Marks in external exam = 19.04 + 1.89 � (Marks in internal exam)

or, M  = 19.04 + 1.89 � M

Ext

Int

FIG. 8.10 Detailed calculation of regression parameters

The model built above can be represented graphically as

an extended version (refer to Fig. 8.11)
a zoom-in version (refer to Fig. 8.12)

Interpretation of the intercept

As we have already seen, the simple linear regression model
built on the data in the example is

M = 19.04 + 1.89 � M

Ext

Int

The value of the intercept from the above equation is 19.05.
However, none of the internal mark is 0. So, intercept = 19.05
indicates that 19.05 is the portion of the external examination
marks not explained by the internal examination marks.

FIG. 8.11 Extended version of the regression graph

FIG. 8.12 Zoom-in regression line

Slope measures the estimated change in the average value of
Y as a result of a one-unit change in X. Here, slope = 1.89 tells
us that the average value of the external examination marks

increases by 1.89 for each additional 1 mark in the internal
examination.

Now that we have a complete understanding of how to build
a simple linear regression model for a given problem, it is time
to summarize the algorithm.

8.3.1.5 OLS algorithm

Step 1: Calculate the mean of X and Y
Step 2: Calculate the errors of X and Y
Step 3: Get the product
Step 4: Get the summation of the products
Step 5: Square the difference of X
Step 6: Get the sum of the squared difference
Step 7: Divide output of step 4 by output of step 6 to calculate �b�
Step 8: Calculate �a� using the value of �b�

8.3.1.6 Maximum and minimum point of curves

Maximum (shown in Fig. 8.13) and minimum points (shown
in Fig. 8.14) on a graph are found at points where the slope of
the curve is zero. It becomes zero either from positive or
negative value. The maximum point is the point on the curve
of the graph with the highest y-coordinate and a slope of zero.
The minimum point is the point on the curve of the graph with
the lowest y-coordinate and a slope of zero.

FIG. 8.13 Maximum point of curve

Point 63 is at the maximum point for this curve (refer to Fig.

8.13). Point 63 is at the highest point on this curve. It has a
greater y-coordinate value than any other point on the curve
and has a slope of zero.

Point 40 (marked with an arrow in Fig. 8.14) is the

minimum point for this curve. Point 40 is at the lowest point
on this curve. It has a lesser y-coordinate value than any other
point on the curve and has a slope of zero.

FIG. 8.14 Minimum point of curve

8.3.2 Multiple Linear Regression

In a multiple regression model, two or more independent
variables, i.e. predictors are involved in the model. If we think
in the context of Karen�s problem, in the last section, we came
up with a simple linear regression by considering Price of a
Property as the dependent variable and the Area of the
Property (in sq. m.) as the predictor variable. However,
location, floor, number of years since purchase, amenities
available, etc. are also important predictors which should not
be ignored. Thus, if we consider Price of a Property (in $) as
the dependent variable and Area of the Property (in sq. m.),
location, floor, number of years since purchase and amenities

available as the independent variables, we can form a multiple
regression equation as shown below:

Price

Property

8.3.3 Assumptions in Regression Analysis

1. The dependent variable (Y) can be calculated / predicated as a linear
function of a specific set of independent variables (X�s) plus an error
term (?).

2. The number of observations (n) is greater than the number of

parameters (k) to be estimated, i.e. n > k.

3. Relationships determined by regression are only relationships of

association based on the data set and not necessarily of cause and effect
of the defined class.

4. Regression line can be valid only over a limited range of data. If the line

is extended (outside the range of extrapolation), it may only lead to
wrong predictions.

5. If the business conditions change and the business assumptions

underlying the regression model are no longer valid, then the past data
set will no longer be able to predict future trends.

6. Variance is the same for all values of X (homoskedasticity).
7. The error term (?) is normally distributed. This also means that the

mean of the error (?) has an expected value of 0.

8. The values of the error (?) are independent and are not related to any
values of X. This means that there are no relationships between a
particular X, Y that are related to another specific value of X, Y.

Given the above assumptions, the OLS estimator is the Best
Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE), and this is called as
Gauss-Markov Theorem.

8.3.4 Main Problems in Regression Analysis

In multiple regressions, there are two primary problems:
multicollinearity and heteroskedasticity.

8.3.4.1 Multicollinearity

Two variables are perfectly collinear if there is an exact linear
relationship between them. Multicollinearity is the situation in
which the degree of correlation is not only between the
dependent variable and the independent variable, but there is
also a strong correlation within (among) the independent

variables themselves. A multiple regression equation can make
good predictions when there is multicollinearity, but it is
difficult for us to determine how the dependent variable will
change if each independent variable is changed one at a time.
When multicollinearity is present, it increases the standard
errors of the coefficients. By overinflating the standard errors,
multicollinearity tries to make some variables statistically
insignificant when they actually should be significant (with
lower standard errors). One way to gauge multicollinearity is
to calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), which
assesses how much the variance of an estimated regression
coefficient increases if the predictors are correlated. If no
factors are correlated, the VIFs will be equal to 1.

The assumption of no perfect collinearity states that there is
no exact linear relationship among the independent variables.
This assumption implies two aspects of the data on the
independent variables. First, none of the independent
variables, other than the variable associated with the intercept
term, can be a constant. Second, variation in the X�s is
necessary. In general, the more variation in the independent
variables, the better will be the OLS estimates in terms of
identifying the impacts of the different independent variables
on the dependent variable.

8.3.4.2 Heteroskedasticity

Heteroskedasticity refers to the changing variance of the error
term. If the variance of the error term is not constant across
data sets, there will be erroneous predictions. In general, for a
regression equation to make accurate predictions, the error
term should be independent, identically (normally) distributed
(iid).

Mathematically, this assumption is written as

where �var� represents the variance, �cov� represents the
covariance, �u� represents the error terms, and �X� represents
the independent variables.

This assumption is more commonly written as

8.3.5 Improving Accuracy of the Linear Regression
Model

Let us understand bias and variance in the regression model
before exploring how to improve the same. The concept of
bias and variance is similar to accuracy and prediction.
Accuracy refers to how close the estimation is near the actual
value, whereas prediction refers to continuous estimation of
the value.

High bias = low accuracy (not close to real value)

High variance = low prediction (values are scattered)

Low bias = high accuracy (close to real value)

Low variance = high prediction (values are close to each other)

Let us say we have a regression model which is highly
accurate and highly predictive; therefore, the overall error of
our model will be low, implying a low bias (high accuracy)
and low variance (high prediction). This is highly preferable.
Similarly, we can say that if the variance increases (low
prediction), the spread of our data points increases, which
results in less accurate prediction. As the bias increases (low
accuracy), the error between our predicted value and the
observed values increases. Therefore, balancing out bias and
accuracy is essential in a regression model.

In the linear regression model, it is assumed that the number

of observations (n) is greater than the number of parameters
(k) to be estimated, i.e. n > k, and in that case, the least squares
estimates tend to have low variance and hence will perform
well on test observations.

However, if observations (n) is not much larger than

parameters (k), then there can be high variability in the least
squares fit, resulting in overfitting and leading to poor
predictions.

If k > n, then linear regression is not usable. This also

indicates infinite variance, and so, the method cannot be used
at all.

Accuracy of linear regression can be improved using the

following three methods:

1. Shrinkage Approach
2. Subset Selection
3. Dimensionality (Variable) Reduction

8.3.5.1 Shrinkage (Regularization) approach

By limiting (shrinking) the estimated coefficients, we can try
to reduce the variance at the cost of a negligible increase in
bias. This can in turn lead to substantial improvements in the
accuracy of the model.

Few variables used in the multiple regression model are in
fact not associated with the overall response and are called as
irrelevant variables; this may lead to unnecessary complexity
in the regression model.

This approach involves fitting a model involving all

predictors. However, the estimated coefficients are shrunken
towards zero relative to the least squares estimates. This
shrinkage (also known as regularization) has the effect of
reducing the overall variance. Some of the coefficients may
also be estimated to be exactly zero, thereby indirectly
performing variable selection. The two best-known techniques
for shrinking the regression coefficients towards zero are

1. ridge regression
2. lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage Selector Operator)

Ridge regression performs L2 regularization, i.e. it adds
penalty equivalent to square of the magnitude of coefficients

Minimization objective of ridge = LS Obj + ? � (sum of

square of coefficients)

Ridge regression (include all k predictors in the final model)
is very similar to least squares, except that the coefficients are
estimated by minimizing a slightly different quantity. If k > n,
then the least squares estimates do not even have a unique

solution, whereas ridge regression can still perform well by
trading off a small increase in bias for a large decrease in
variance. Thus, ridge regression works best in situations where
the least squares estimates have high variance. One
disadvantage with ridge regression is that it will include all k
predictors in the final model. This may not be a problem for
prediction accuracy, but it can create a challenge in model
interpretation in settings in which the number of variables k is
quite large. Ridge regression will perform better when the
response is a function of many predictors, all with coefficients
of roughly equal size.

Lasso regression performs L1 regularization, i.e. it adds
penalty equivalent to the absolute value of the magnitude of
coefficients.

Minimization objective of ridge = LS Obj + ? � (absolute

value of the magnitude of coefficients)

The lasso overcomes this disadvantage by forcing some of
the coefficients to zero value. We can say that the lasso yields
sparse models (involving only subset) that are simpler as well
as more interpretable. The lasso can be expected to perform
better in a setting where a relatively small number of
predictors have substantial coefficients, and the remaining
predictors have coefficients that are very small or equal to
zero.

8.3.5.2 Subset selection

Identify a subset of the predictors that is assumed to be related
to the response and then fit a model using OLS on the selected
reduced subset of variables. There are two methods in which
subset of the regression can be selected:

k

1. Best subset selection (considers all the possible (2 ))
2. Stepwise subset selection

k

1. Forward stepwise selection (0 to k)
2. Backward stepwise selection (k to 0)

In best subset selection, we fit a separate least squares
regression for each possible subset of the k predictors. For
computational reasons, best subset selection cannot be applied
with very large value of predictors (k). The best subset
selection procedure considers all the possible (2 ) models
containing subsets of the p predictors.

k

The stepwise subset selection method can be applied to

choose the best subset. There are two stepwise subset
selection:

1. Forward stepwise selection (0 to k)
2. Backward stepwise selection (k to 0)

Forward stepwise selection is a computationally efficient

alternative to best subset selection. Forward stepwise
considers a much smaller set of models, that too step by step,
compared to best set selection. Forward stepwise selection
begins with a model containing no predictors, and then,
predictors are added one by one to the model, until all the k
predictors are included in the model. In particular, at each step,
the variable (X) that gives the highest additional improvement
to the fit is added.

Backward stepwise selection begins with the least squares

model which contains all k predictors and then iteratively
removes the least useful predictor one by one.

8.3.5.3 Dimensionality reduction (Variable reduction)

The earlier methods, namely subset selection and shrinkage,
control variance either by using a subset of the original
variables or by shrinking their coefficients towards zero. In
dimensionality reduction, predictors (X) are transformed, and
the model is set up using the transformed variables after
dimensionality reduction. The number of variables is reduced
using the dimensionality reduction method. Principal
component analysis is one of the most important
dimensionality (variable) reduction techniques.

8.3.6 Polynomial Regression Model

Polynomial regression model is the extension of the simple
linear model by adding extra predictors obtained by raising
(squaring) each of the original predictors to a power. For
example, if there are three variables, X, X , and X  are used as
predictors. This approach provides a simple way to yield a
non-linear fit to data.

data points. The regression line will curve further if we
increase the polynomial degree (refer to Fig. 8.17). At the
extreme value as shown below, the regression line will be
overfitting into all the original values of X.

8.3.7 Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is both classification and regression
technique depending on the scenario used. Logistic regression
(logit regression) is a type of regression analysis used for
predicting the outcome of a categorical dependent variable
similar to OLS regression. In logistic regression, dependent
variable (Y) is binary (0,1) and independent variables (X) are
continuous in nature. The probabilities describing the possible
outcomes (probability that Y = 1) of a single trial are modelled
as a logistic function of the predictor variables. In the logistic
2
regression model, there is no R  to gauge the fit of the overall
model; however, a chi-square test is used to gauge how well
the logistic regression model fits the data. The goal of logistic
regression is to predict the likelihood that Y is equal to 1
(probability that Y = 1 rather than 0) given certain values of X.
That is, if X and Y have a strong positive linear relationship,
the probability that a person will have a score of Y = 1 will
increase as values of X increase. So, we are predicting
probabilities rather than the scores of the dependent variable.

For example, we might try to predict whether or not a small
project will succeed or fail on the basis of the number of years
of experience of the project manager handling the project. We
presume that those project managers who have been managing
projects for many years will be more likely to succeed. This
means that as X (the number of years of experience of project
manager) increases, the probability that Y will be equal to 1
(success of the new project) will tend to increase. If we take a
hypothetical example in which 60 already executed projects
were studied and the years of experience of project managers
ranges from 0 to 20 years, we could represent this tendency to
increase the probability that Y = 1 with a graph.

To illustrate this, it is convenient to segregate years of
experience into categories (i.e. 0�8, 9�16, 17�24, 25�32, 33�
40). If we compute the mean score on Y (averaging the 0s and
1s) for each category of years of experience, we will get
something like

When the graph is drawn for the above values of X and Y, it

appears like the graph in Figure 8.18. As X increases, the
probability that Y = 1 increases. In other words, when the
project manager has more years of experience, a larger
percentage of projects succeed. A perfect relationship
represents a perfectly curved S rather than a straight line, as
was the case in OLS regression. So, to model this relationship,
we need some fancy algebra / mathematics that accounts for
the bends in the curve.

An explanation of logistic regression begins with an

explanation of the logistic function, which always takes values
between zero and one. The logistic formulae are stated in
terms of the probability that Y = 1, which is referred to as P.
The probability that Y is 0 is 1 ? P.

FIG. 8.18 Logistic regression

The �ln� symbol refers to a natural logarithm and a + bX is

the regression line equation. Probability (P) can also be
computed from the regression equation. So, if we know the
regression equation, we could, theoretically, calculate the
expected probability that Y = 1 for a given value of X.

�exp� is the exponent function, which is sometimes also

written as e.

Let us say we have a model that can predict whether a
person is male or female on the basis of their height. Given a

height of 150 cm, we need to predict whether the person is
male or female.

We know that the coefficients of a = ?100 and b = 0.6.
Using the above equation, we can calculate the probability of
male given a height of 150 cm or more formally P(male|height
= 150).

y = e^(a + b � X)/(1 + e^(a + b � X))
y = exp ( ?100 + 0.6 � 150)/(1 + EXP( ?100 + 0.6 � X)
y = 0.000046

or a probability of near zero that the person is a male.

Assumptions in logistic regression

The following assumptions must hold when building a logistic
regression model:

There exists a linear relationship between logit function and independent
variables
The dependent variable Y must be categorical (1/0) and take binary value,
e.g. if pass then Y = 1; else Y = 0
The data meets the �iid� criterion, i.e. the error terms, ?, are independent from
one another and identically distributed
The error term follows a binomial distribution [n, p]

n = # of records in the data
p = probability of success (pass, responder)

8.3.8 Maximum Likelihood Estimation

The coefficients in a logistic regression are estimated using a
process called Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). First,
let us understand what is likelihood function before moving to

MLE. A fair coin outcome flips equally heads and tails of the
same number of times. If we toss the coin 10 times, it is
expected that we get five times Head and five times Tail.

Let us now discuss about the probability of getting only

Head as an outcome; it is 5/10 = 0.5 in the above case.
Whenever this number (P) is greater than 0.5, it is said to be in
favour of Head. Whenever P is lesser than 0.5, it is said to be
against the outcome of getting Head.

Let us represent �n� flips of coin as X , X , X ,�, X . Now

When we use the Bernoulli distribution represents each flip

of the coin:

Each observation X  is independent and also identically

i

distributed (iid), and the joint distribution simplifies to a
product of distributions.

where #H is the number of flips that resulted in the expected

outcome (heads in this case).

The likelihood equation is

But the likelihood function is not a probability. The

likelihood for some coins may be 0.25 or 0 or 1.

MLE is about predicting the value for the parameters that

maximizes the likelihood function.

8.4 SUMMARY

In supervised learning, when we are trying to predict a real-value variable
such as �Price�, �Weight�, etc., the problem falls under the category of
regression. A regression problem tries to forecast results as a continuous
output.
Dependent Variable (Y) is the value to be predicted. This variable is
presumed to be functionally related to the independent variable (X). In other
words, dependent variable(s) depends on independent variable(s).
Independent Variable (X) is called as predictor. The independent variable (X)
is used in a regression model to estimate the value of the dependent variable
(Y).
Regression is essentially finding a relationship (or) association between the
dependent variable (Y) and the independent variables (X).
If the regression involves only one independent variable, it is called simple
regression. Thus, if we take �Price of a used car� as the dependent variable
and the �Year of manufacturing of the car� as the independent variable, we
can build a simple regression.
Slope represents how much the line in a graph changes in the vertical
direction (Y-axis) over a change in the horizontal direction (X-axis). Slope is
also referred as the rate of change in a graph.
Maximum and minimum points on a graph are found at points where the
slope of the curve is zero. It becomes zero either from positive or from
negative value.
If two or more independent variables are involved, it is called multiple
regression. Thus, if we take �Price of a used car� as the dependent variable
and year of manufacturing (Year), brand of the car (Brand), and mileage run

(Miles run) as the independent variables, we can form a multiple regression
equation as given below:

Price of a used car ($) = function (Year, Brand, Miles run)

Multicollinearity is the situation in which the degree of correlation is not
only between the dependent variable and the independent variable, but there
also exists a strong correlation within (among) the independent variables
itself.
Heteroskedasticity refers to the changing variance of the error term. If the
variance of the error term is not constant across data sets, there will be
erroneous predictions. In general, for a regression equation to make accurate
predictions, the error term should be independent, normally (identically)
distributed (iid). The error terms should not be related to each other.
Accuracy of linear regression can be improved using the following three
methods:

1. Shrinkage Approach
2. Subset Selection
3. Dimensionality Reduction

Polynomial regression model is the extension of the simple linear model by
adding extra predictors, obtained by raising (squaring) each of the original
3
predictors to a power. For example, if there are three variables, X, X , and X
are used as predictors.
In logistic regression, the dependent variable (Y) is binary (0,1) and
independent variables (X) are continuous in nature. The probabilities
describing the possible outcomes (probability that Y = 1) of a single trial are
modelled as a function of the explanatory (predictor) variables by using a
logistic function.

Unsupervised Learning

OBJECTIVE OF THE CHAPTER :

We have discussed how to train our machines with past
data on the basis of which they can learn, gain intelligence,
and apply that intelligence on a new set of data. There are,
however, situations when we do not have any prior
knowledge of the data set we are working with, but we still
want to discover interesting relationships among the
attributes of the data or group the data in logical segments
for easy analysis. The task of the machine is then to
identify this knowledge without any prior training and that
is the space of unsupervised learning. In this chapter, we
will discuss how Clustering algorithms help in grouping
data sets into logical segments and the association analysis
which enables to identify a pattern or relationship of
attributes within the data set. An interesting application of
the association analysis is the Market Basket Analysis,
which is used widely by retailers and advertisers across the
globe.

9.1 INTRODUCTION

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning concept where
the unlabelled and unclassified information is analysed to
discover hidden knowledge. The algorithms work on the data
without any prior training, but they are constructed in such a
way that they can identify patterns, groupings, sorting order,
and numerous other interesting knowledge from the set of
data.

Till now, we have discussed about supervised learning where
the aim was to predict the outcome variable Y on the basis of
the feature set X :X :� X , and we discussed methods such as
regression and classification for the same. We will now
introduce the concept of unsupervised learning where the
objective is to observe only the features X :X :� X ; we are
not going to predict any outcome variable, but rather our
intention is to find out the association between the features or
their grouping to understand the nature of the data. This
analysis may reveal an interesting correlation between the
features or a common behaviour within the subgroup of the
data, which provides better understanding of the data.

In terms of statistics, a supervised learning algorithm will
try to learn the probability of outcome Y for a particular input
X, which is called the posterior probability. Unsupervised
learning is closely related to density estimation in statistics.
Here, every input and the corresponding targets are
concatenated to create a new set of input such as {(X , Y ),
(X , Y ),�, (X , Y )}, which leads to a better understanding of
the correlation of X and Y; this probability notation is called
the joint probability.

Let us take an example of how unsupervised learning helps
in pushing movie promotions to the correct group of people. In

earlier days, movie promotions were blind push of the same
data to all demography, such that everyone used to watch the
same posters or trailers irrespective of their choice or
preference. So, in most of the cases, the person watching the
promotion or trailer would end up ignoring it, which leads to
waste of effort and money on the promotion. But with the
advent of smart devices and apps, there is now a huge database
available to understand what type of movie is liked by what
segment of the demography. Machine learning helps to find
out the pattern or the repeated behaviour of the smaller
groups/clusters within this database to provide the intelligence
about liking or disliking of certain types of movies by different
groups within the demography. So, by using this intelligence,
the smart apps can push only the relevant movie promotions or
trailers to the selected groups, which will significantly increase
the chance of targeting the right interested person for the
movie.

We will discuss two methods in this chapter for explaining

the principle underlying unsupervised learning � Clustering
and Association Analysis. Clustering is a broad class of
methods used for discovering unknown subgroups in data,
which is the most important concept in unsupervised learning.
Another technique is Association Analysis which identifies a
low-dimensional representation of the observations that can
explain the variance and identify the association rule for the
explanation.

9.3 APPLICATION OF UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

Because of its flexibility that it can work on uncategorized and
unlabelled data, there are many domains where unsupervised
learning finds its application. Few examples of such
applications are as follows:

Segmentation of target consumer populations by an advertisement consulting
agency on the basis of few dimensions such as demography, financial data,
purchasing habits, etc. so that the advertisers can reach their target
consumers efficiently
Anomaly or fraud detection in the banking sector by identifying the pattern
of loan defaulters
Image processing and image segmentation such as face recognition,
expression identification, etc.
Grouping of important characteristics in genes to identify important
influencers in new areas of genetics
Utilization by data scientists to reduce the dimensionalities in sample data to
simplify modelling
Document clustering and identifying potential labelling options

Today, unsupervised learning is used in many areas

involving Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML). Chat bots, self-driven cars, and many more recent
innovations are results of the combination of unsupervised and
supervised learning.

So, in this chapter, we will cover two major aspects of
unsupervised learning, namely Clustering which helps in
segmentation of the set of objects into groups of similar
objects and Association Analysis which is related to the
identification of relationships among objects in a data set.

9.4 CLUSTERING

Clustering refers to a broad set of techniques for finding
subgroups, or clusters, in a data set on the basis of the
characteristics of the objects within that data set in such a
manner that the objects within the group are similar (or related
to each other) but are different from (or unrelated to) the
objects from the other groups. The effectiveness of clustering
depends on how similar or related the objects within a group
are or how different or unrelated the objects in different groups
are from each other. It is often domain specific to define what

is meant by two objects to be similar or dissimilar and thus is
an important aspect of the unsupervised machine learning task.

As an example, suppose we want to run some

advertisements of a new movie for a countrywide promotional
activity. We have data for the age, location, financial
condition, and political stability of the people in different parts
of the country. We may want to run a different type of
campaign for the different parts grouped according to the data
we have. Any logical grouping obtained by analysing the
characteristics of the people will help us in driving the
campaigns in a more targeted way. Clustering analysis can
help in this activity by analysing different ways to group the
set of people and arriving at different types of clusters.

There are many different fields where cluster analysis is

used effectively, such as

Text data mining: this includes tasks such as text categorization, text
clustering, document summarization, concept extraction, sentiment analysis,
and entity relation modelling
Customer segmentation: creating clusters of customers on the basis of
parameters such as demographics, financial conditions, buying habits, etc.,
which can be used by retailers and advertisers to promote their products in
the correct segment
Anomaly checking: checking of anomalous behaviours such as fraudulent
bank transaction, unauthorized computer intrusion, suspicious movements on
a radar scanner, etc.
Data mining: simplify the data mining task by grouping a large number of
features from an extremely large data set to make the analysis manageable

In this section, we will discuss the methods related to the
machine learning task of clustering, which involves finding
natural groupings of data. The focus will be on

how clustering tasks differ from classification tasks and how clustering
defines groups

a classic and easy-to-understand clustering algorithm, namely k-means,
which is used for clustering along with the k-medoids algorithm
application of clustering in real-life scenarios

9.4.1 Clustering as a machine learning task

The primary driver of clustering knowledge is discovery rather
than prediction, because we may not even know what we are
looking for before starting the clustering analysis. So,
clustering is defined as an unsupervised machine learning task
that automatically divides the data into clusters or groups of
similar items. The analysis achieves this without prior
knowledge of the types of groups required and thus can
provide an insight into the natural groupings within the data
set. The primary guideline of clustering task is that the data
inside a cluster should be very similar to each other but very
different from those outside the cluster. We can assume that
the definition of similarity might vary across applications, but
the basic idea is always the same, that is, to create the group
such that related elements are placed together. Using this
principle, whenever a large set of diverse and varied data is
presented for analysis, clustering enables to represent the data
in a smaller number of groups. It helps to reduce the
complexity and provides insight into patterns of relationships
to generate meaningful and actionable structures within the
data. The effectiveness of clustering is measured by the
homogeneity within a group as well as the difference between
distinct groups. See Figure 9.1 for reference.

From the above discussion, it may seem that through

clustering, we are trying to label the objects with class labels.
But clustering is somewhat different from the classification
and numeric prediction discussed in supervised learning
chapters. In each of these cases, the goal was to create a model
that relates features to an outcome or to other features and the

model identifies patterns within the data. In contrast, clustering
creates new data. Unlabelled objects are given a cluster label
which is inferred entirely from the relationship of attributes
within the data.

Let us take an example. You were invited to take a session
on Machine Learning in a reputed university for induction of
their professors on the subject. Before you create the material
for the session, you want to know the level of acquaintance of
the professors on the subject so that the session is successful.
But you do not want to ask the inviting university, but rather
do some analysis on your own on the basis of the data
available freely. As Machine Learning is the intersection of
Statistics and Computer Science, you focused on identifying
the professors from these two areas also. So, you searched the
list of research publications of these professors from the
internet, and by using the machine learning algorithm, you
now want to group the papers and thus infer the expertise of
the professors into three buckets � Statistics, Computer
Science, and Machine Learning.

After plotting the number of publications of these professors
in the two core areas, namely Statistics and Computer Science,
you obtain a scatter plot as shown in Figure 9.2.

FIG. 9.1 Unsupervised learning � clustering

FIG. 9.2 Data set for the conference attendees

Some inferences that can be derived from the pattern
analysis of the data is that there seems to be three groups or
clusters emerging from the data. The pure statisticians have
very less Computer Science-related papers, whereas the pure
Computer Science professors have less number of statistics-
related papers than Computer Science-related papers. There is
a third cluster of professors who have published papers on
both these areas and thus can be assumed to be the persons
knowledgeable in machine learning concepts, as shown in
Figure 9.3.

Thus, in the above problem, we used visual indication of
logical grouping of data to identify a pattern or cluster and
labelled the data in three different clusters. The main driver for
our clustering was the closeness of the points to each other to
form a group. The clustering algorithm uses a very similar
approach to measure how closely the data points are related
and decides whether they can be labelled as a homogeneous
group. In the next section, we will discuss few important
algorithms for clustering.

FIG. 9.3 Clusters for the conference attendees

9.4.2 Different types of clustering techniques

The major clustering techniques are

Partitioning methods,
Hierarchical methods, and
Density-based methods.

Their approach towards creating the clusters, way to
measure the quality of the clusters, and applicability are
different. Table 9.1 summarizes the main characteristics of
each method for each reference.

Table 9.1 Different Clustering Methods

We will discuss each of these methods and their related

techniques in details in the following sections.

9.4.3 Partitioning methods

Two of the most important algorithms for partitioning-based
clustering are k-means and k-medoid. In the k-means
algorithm, the centroid of the prototype is identified for
clustering, which is normally the mean of a group of points.
Similarly, the k-medoid algorithm identifies the medoid which
is the most representative point for a group of points. We can
also infer that in most cases, the centroid does not correspond
to an actual data point, whereas medoid is always an actual
data point. Let us discuss both these algorithms in detail.

9.4.3.1 K-means - A centroid-based technique

This is one of the oldest and most popularly used algorithm for
clustering. The basic principles used by this algorithm also

serves as the basis for other more sophisticated and complex
algorithms. Table 9.2 provides the strengths and weaknesses
of this algorithm.

The principle of the k-means algorithm is to assign each of
the �n� data points to one of the K clusters where �K� is a user-
defined parameter as the number of clusters desired. The
objective is to maximize the homogeneity within the clusters
and also to maximize the differences between the clusters. The
homogeneity and differences are measured in terms of the
distance between the objects or points in the data set.

Algorithm 9.1 shows the simple algorithm of K-means

Step 1: Select K points in the data space and mark them as initial centroids

loop

Step 2: Assign each point in the data space to the nearest centroid to form K
clusters

Step 3: Measure the distance of each point in the cluster from the centroid

Step 4: Calculate the Sum of Squared Error (SSE) to measure the quality of
the clusters (described later in this chapter)

Step 5: Identify the new centroid of each cluster on the basis of distance
between points

Step 6: Repeat Steps 2 to 5 to refine until centroids do not change

end loop

Table 9.2 Strengths and Weaknesses of K-means

Let us understand this algorithm with an example. In Figure
9.4, we have certain set of data points, and we will apply the k-
means algorithm to find out the clusters generated from this
data set. Let us fix K = 4, implying that we want to create four
clusters out of this data set. As the first step, we assign four
random points from the data set as the centroids, as
represented by the * signs, and we assign the data points to the
nearest centroid to create four clusters. In the second step, on
the basis of the distance of the points from the corresponding
centroids, the centroids are updated and points are reassigned
to the updated centroids. After three iterations, we found that
the centroids are not moving as there is no scope for
refinement, and thus, the k-means algorithm will terminate.
This provides us the most logical four groupings or cluster of
the data sets where the homogeneity within the groups is
highest and difference between the groups is maximum.

FIG. 9.4 Clustering concept � before and after clustering

Choosing appropriate number of clusters

One of the most important success factors in arriving at correct
clustering is to start with the correct number of cluster
assumptions. Different numbers of starting cluster lead to
completely different types of data split. It will always help if
we have some prior knowledge about the number of clusters
and we start our k-means algorithm with that prior knowledge.
For example, if we are clustering the data of the students of a
university, it is always better to start with the number of
departments in that university. Sometimes, the business needs
or resource limitations drive the number of required clusters.
For example, if a movie maker wants to cluster the movies on
the basis of combination of two parameters � budget of the
movie: high or low, and casting of the movie: star or non-star,
then there are 4 possible combinations, and thus, there can be
four clusters to split the data.

For a small data set, sometimes a rule of thumb that is

followed is

which means that K is set as the square root of n/2 for a data

set of n examples. But unfortunately, this thumb rule does not
work well for large data sets. There are several statistical
methods to arrive at the suitable number of clusters.

Elbow method

This method tries to measure the homogeneity or
heterogeneity within the cluster and for various values of �K�
and helps in arriving at the optimal �K�. From Figure 9.5, we
can see the homogeneity will increase or heterogeneity will
decrease with increasing �K� as the number of data points
inside each cluster reduces with this increase. But these
iterations take significant computation effort, and after a
certain point, the increase in homogeneity benefit is no longer
in accordance with the investment required to achieve it, as is
evident from the figure. This point is known as the elbow
point, and the �K� value at this point produces the optimal
clustering performance. There are a large number of
algorithms to calculate the homogeneity and heterogeneity of
the clusters, which are not discussed in this book.

Choosing the initial centroids

Another key step for the k-means algorithm is to choose the
initial centroids properly. One common practice is to choose
random points in the data space on the basis of the number of
cluster requirement and refine the points as we move into the
iterations. But this often leads to higher squared error in the
final clustering, thus resulting in sub-optimal clustering
solution. The assumption for selecting random centroids is that

multiple subsequent runs will minimize the SSE and identify
the optimal clusters. But this is often not true on the basis of
the spread of the data set and the number of clusters sought.
So, one effective approach is to employ the hierarchical
clustering technique on sample points from the data set and
then arrive at sample K clusters. The centroids of these initial
K clusters are used as the initial centroids. This approach is
practical when the data set has small number of points and K is
relatively small compared to the data points. There are
procedures such as bisecting k-means and use of post-
processing to fix initial clustering issues; these procedures can
produce better quality initial centroids and thus better SSE for
the final clusters.

FIG. 9.5 Elbow point to determine the appropriate number of clusters

Recomputing cluster centroids

We discussed in the k-means algorithm that the iterative step is
to recalculate the centroids of the data set after each iteration.
The proximities of the data points from each other within a
cluster is measured to minimize the distances. The distance of
the data point from its nearest centroid can also be calculated
to minimize the distances to arrive at the refined centroid. The
Euclidean distance between two data points is measured as
follows:

Using this function, the distance between the example data

and its nearest centroid and the objective is calculated to
minimize this distance. The measure of quality of clustering
uses the SSE technique. The formula used is as follows:

i

i

where dist() calculates the Euclidean distance between the
centroid c  of the cluster C  and the data points x in the cluster.
The summation of such distances over all the �K� clusters
gives the total sum of squared error. As you can understand,
the lower the SSE for a clustering solution, the better is the
representative position of the centroid. Thus, in our clustering
algorithm in Algorithm 9.1, the recomputation of the
centroid involves calculating the SSE of each new centroid
and arriving at the optimal centroid identification. After the
centroids are repositioned, the data points nearest to the
centroids are assigned to form the refined clusters. It is
observed that the centroid that minimizes the SSE of the
cluster is its mean. One limitation of the squared error method
is that in the case of presence of outliers in the data set, the
squared error can distort the mean value of the clusters.

Let us use this understanding to identify the cluster step for

the data set in Figure 9.6. Assume that the number of cluster
requirement, K = 4. We will randomly select four cluster
centroids as indicated by four different colours in Figure 9.7.

Now, on the basis of the proximity of the data points in this

data set to the centroids, we partition the data set into four
segments as represented by dashed lines in Figure 9.8. This
diagram is called Voronoi diagram which creates the
boundaries of the clusters. We got the initial four clusters,
namely C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , and C 4 , created by the dashed lines
from the vertex of the clusters, which is the point with the
maximal distance from the centre of the clusters. It is now easy
to understand the areas covered by each cluster and the data
points within each cluster through this representation.

FIG. 9.6 Clustering of data set

FIG. 9.7 Clustering with initial centroids

FIG. 9.8 Iteration 1: Four clusters and distance of points from the centroids

3

The next step is to calculate the SSE of this clustering and
update the position of the centroids. We can also proceed by
our understanding that the new centroid should be the mean of
the data points in the respective clusters. The distances of the
data points currently marked as Cluster C  from the centroid of
cluster C  are marked as a  , a  ,�, a  in the figure and those
i2
determine the homogeneity within cluster C . On the other
hand, the distances of data points of cluster C  from the
centroid of cluster C  determine the heterogeneity among these
two different clusters. Our aim is to minimize the homogeneity
within the clusters and maximize the heterogeneity among the
different clusters. So, the revised centroids are as shown in
Figure 9.9.

We can also find out that the cluster boundaries are refined
on the basis of the new centroids and the identification of the
nearest centroids for the data points and reassigning them to
the new centroids. The new points reclaimed by each cluster
are shown in the diagram.

The k-means algorithm continues with the update of the
centroid according to the new cluster and reassignment of the
points, until no more data points are changed due to the
centroid shift. At this point, the algorithm stops. Figure 9.10
shows the final clustering of the data set we used. The
complexity of the k-means algorithm is O ( nKt ), where � n �
is the total number of data points or objects in the data set, K is
the number of clusters, and � t � is the number of iterations.
Normally, � K � and � t � are kept much smaller than � n �, and
thus, the k-means method is relatively scalable and efficient in
processing large data sets.

clusters according to the nearest centroid

FIG. 9.10 Iteration 3: Final cluster arrangement: Centroids recomputed and points
redistributed among the clusters according to the nearest centroid

Points to Ponder:

Because of the distance-based approach from the centroid
to all points in the data set, the k-means method may not
always converge to the global optimum and often
terminates at a local optimum. The result of the clustering
largely depends on the initial random selection of cluster
centres.

k-means often produce local optimum and not global optimum.
Also, the result depends on the initial selection of random
cluster centroids. It is a common practice to run the k-means
algorithm multiple times with different cluster centres to
identify the optimal clusters. The necessity to set the initial �K�
values is also perceived as a disadvantage of the k-means
algorithm. There are methods to overcome this problem, such
as defining a range for �K� and then comparing the results of
clustering with those different �K� values to arrive at the best
possible cluster. The ways to improve cluster performance is
an area of further study, and many different techniques are
employed to achieve that. This is out of scope of this book but
can be pursued for advanced machine learning studies.

Note:

Clustering is often used as the first step of identifying the
subgroups within a unlabeled set of data which then is
used for classifying the new observed data. At the
beginning we are not clear about the pattern or classes that
exist within the unlabeled data set. By using the clustering
algorithm at that stage we find out the groups of similar
objects within the data set and form sub-groups and
classes. Later when a new object is observed, then using
the classification algorithms we try to place that into one
of the sub-groups identified in the earlier stage. Let�s take
an example. We are running a software testing activity and
we identified a set of defects in the software. For easy
allocation of these defects to different developer groups,
the team is trying to identify similar groups of defects.
Often text analytics is used as the guiding principle for
identifying this similarity. Suppose there are 4 sub-groups
of defects identified, namely, GUI related defects, Business
logic related defects, Missing requirement defects and
Database related defects. Based on this grouping, the team
identified the developers to whom the defects should be
sent for fixing. As the testing continues, there are new
defects getting created. We have the categories of defects
identified now and thus the team can use classification
algorithms to assign the new defect to one of the 4
identified groups or classes which will make it easy to
identify the developer who should be fixing it.

9.4.4 K-Medoids: a representative object-based
technique

As discussed earlier, the k-means algorithm is sensitive to
outliers in the data set and inadvertently produces skewed
clusters when the means of the data points are used as

centroids. Let us take an example of eight data points, and for
simplicity, we can consider them to be 1-D data with values 1,
2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, and 25. Point 25 is the outlier, and it affects
the cluster formation negatively when the mean of the points is
considered as centroids.

With K = 2, the initial clusters we arrived at are {1, 2, 3, 6}

and {9, 10, 11, 25}.

The mean of the cluster

and the mean of the cluster

So, the SSE within the clusters is

If we compare this with the cluster {1, 2, 3, 6, 9} and {10,

11, 25},

the mean of the cluster

and the mean of the cluster

So, the SSE within the clusters is

Because the SSE of the second clustering is lower, k-means

tend to put point 9 in the same cluster with 1, 2, 3, and 6
though the point is logically nearer to points 10 and 11. This
skewedness is introduced due to the outlier point 25, which
shifts the mean away from the centre of the cluster.

k-medoids provides a solution to this problem. Instead of

considering the mean of the data points in the cluster, k-
medoids considers k representative data points from the
existing points in the data set as the centre of the clusters. It
then assigns the data points according to their distance from
these centres to form k clusters. Note that the medoids in this
case are actual data points or objects from the data set and not
an imaginary point as in the case when the mean of the data
sets within cluster is used as the centroid in the k-means
technique. The SSE is calculated as

where o  is the representative point or object of cluster C .
i

i

Thus, the k-medoids method groups n objects in k clusters
by minimizing the SSE. Because of the use of medoids from
the actual representative data points, k-medoids is less
influenced by the outliers in the data. One of the practical
implementation of the k-medoids principle is the Partitioning

Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm. Refer to Algorithm 2
table:

In this algorithm, we replaced the current representative

clusters get refined after each medoid is replaced with a new
non-representative medoid. Each time a reassignment is done,
the SSE based on the new medoid is calculated. The difference
between the SSE before and after the swap indicates whether
or not the replacement is improving the quality of the
clustering by bringing the most similar points together.

Points to Ponder:

k-medoids methods like PAM works well for small set of
data, but they are not scalable for large set of data because
of computational overhead. A sample-based technique is
used in the case of large data set where the sample should
be a good representative of the whole data set.

Though the k-medoids algorithm provides an effective way
to eliminate the noise or outliers in the data set, which was the
problem in the k-means algorithm, it is expensive in terms of
calculations. The complexity of each iteration in the k-medoids
algorithm is O(k(n - k) ). For large value of �n� and �k�, this
calculation becomes much costlier than that of the k-means
algorithm.

9.4.5 Hierarchical clustering

Till now, we have discussed the various methods for
partitioning the data into different clusters. But there are
situations when the data needs to be partitioned into groups at
different levels such as in a hierarchy. The hierarchical
clustering methods are used to group the data into hierarchy or
tree-like structure. For example, in a machine learning
problem of organizing employees of a university in different
departments, first the employees are grouped under the
different departments in the university, and then within each
department, the employees can be grouped according to their
roles such as professors, assistant professors, supervisors, lab
assistants, etc. This creates a hierarchical structure of the
employee data and eases visualization and analysis. Similarly,
there may be a data set which has an underlying hierarchy
structure that we want to discover and we can use the
hierarchical clustering methods to achieve that.

There are two main hierarchical clustering methods:

agglomerative clustering and divisive clustering.
Agglomerative clustering is a bottom-up technique which
starts with individual objects as clusters and then iteratively
merges them to form larger clusters. On the other hand, the
divisive method starts with one cluster with all given objects

and then splits it iteratively to form smaller clusters. See
Figure 9.12.

The agglomerative hierarchical clustering method uses the
bottom-up strategy. It starts with each object forming its own
cluster and then iteratively merges the clusters according to
their similarity to form larger clusters. It terminates either
when a certain clustering condition imposed by the user is
achieved or all the clusters merge into a single cluster.

The divisive hierarchical clustering method uses a top-down

strategy. The starting point is the largest cluster with all the
objects in it, and then, it is split recursively to form smaller
and smaller clusters, thus forming the hierarchy. The end of
iterations is achieved when the objects in the final clusters are
sufficiently homogeneous to each other or the final clusters
contain only one object or the user-defined clustering
condition is achieved.

In both these cases, it is important to select the split and

merger points carefully, because the subsequent splits or
mergers will use the result of the previous ones and there is no
option to perform any object swapping between the clusters or
rectify the decisions made in previous steps, which may result
in poor clustering quality at the end.

A dendrogram is a commonly used tree structure
representation of step-by-step creation of hierarchical
clustering. It shows how the clusters are merged iteratively (in
the case of agglomerative clustering) or split iteratively (in the
case of divisive clustering) to arrive at the optimal clustering
solution. Figure 9.13 shows a dendro-gram with four levels
and how the objects are merged or split at each level to arrive
at the hierarchical clustering.

FIG. 9.12 Agglomerative and divisive hierarchical clustering

One of the core measures of proximities between clusters is
the distance between them. There are four standard methods to
measure the distance between clusters:

i

j

Let C  and C  be the two clusters with n  and n  respectively.

p  and p  represents the points in clusters C  and C
j

respectively. We will denote the mean of cluster C  as m
i.

Refer to Figure 9.14 for understanding the concept of these

distances.

FIG. 9.13 Dendrogram representation of hierarchical clustering

FIG. 9.14 Distance measure in algorithmic methods

Often the distance measure is used to decide when to

terminate the clustering algorithm. For example, in an
agglomerative clustering, the merging iterations may be

stopped once the MIN distance between two neighbouring
clusters becomes less than the user-defined threshold. So,
when an algorithm uses the minimum distance D  to
measure the distance between the clusters, then it is referred to
as nearest neighbour clustering algorithm, and if the decision
to stop the algorithm is based on a user-defined limit on D ,
min
then it is called single linkage algorithm.

min

max

On the other hand, when an algorithm uses the maximum
distance D  to measure the distance between the clusters,
then it is referred to as furthest neighbour clustering algorithm,
and if the decision to stop the algorithm is based on a user-
defined limit on D  then it is called complete linkage
algorithm.

max

As minimum and maximum measures provide two extreme

options to measure distance between the clusters, they are
prone to the outliers and noisy data. Instead, the use of mean
and average distance helps in avoiding such problem and
provides more consistent results.

9.4.6 Density-based methods - DBSCAN

You might have noticed that when we used the partitioning
and hierarchical clustering methods, the resulting clusters are
spherical or nearly spherical in nature. In the case of the other
shaped clusters such as S-shaped or uneven shaped clusters,
the above two types of method do not provide accurate results.
The density-based clustering approach provides a solution to
identify clusters of arbitrary shapes. The principle is based on
identifying the dense area and sparse area within the data set
and then run the clustering algorithm. DBSCAN is one of the
popular density-based algorithm which creates clusters by
using connected regions with high density.

9.5 FINDING PATTERN USING ASSOCIATION RULE

Association rule presents a methodology that is useful for
identifying interesting relationships hidden in large data sets. It
is also known as association analysis, and the discovered
relationships can be represented in the form of association
rules comprising a set of frequent items. A common
application of this analysis is the Market Basket Analysis
that retailers use for cross-selling of their products. For
example, every large grocery store accumulates a large volume
of data about the buying pattern of the customers. On the basis
of the items purchased together, the retailers can push some
cross-selling either by placing the items bought together in
adjacent areas or creating some combo offer with those
different product types. The below association rule signifies
that people who have bought bread and milk have often bought
egg also; so, for the retailer, it makes sense that these items are
placed together for new opportunities for cross-selling.

{Bread, Milk} ? {Egg}

The application of association analysis is also widespread in

other domains such as bioinformatics, medical diagnosis,
scientific data analysis, and web data mining. For example, by
discovering the interesting relationship between food habit and
patients developing breast cancer, a new cancer prevention
mechanism can be found which will benefit thousands of
people in the world. In this book, we will mainly illustrate the
analysis techniques by using the market basket example, but it
can be used more widely across domains to identify
association among items in transactional data. The huge pool

of data generated everyday through tracked transactions such
as barcode scanner, online purchase, and inventory tracking
systems has enabled for machine learning systems to learn
from this wealth of data. We will discuss the methods for
finding useful associations in large databases by using simple
statistical performance measures while managing the
peculiarities of working with such transactional data. One
significant challenge in working with the large volume of data
is that it may be computationally very expensive to discover
patterns from such data. Moreover, there may be cases when
some of the associations occurred by chance, which can lead
to potentially false knowledge. While discussing the
association analysis, we will discuss both these points.

We will use the transaction data in the table below for our
examples of association analysis. This simplified version of
the market basket data will show how the association rules can
be effectively used for the market basket analysis.

9.5.1 Definition of common terms

Let us understand few common terminologies used in
association analysis.

9.5.1.1 Itemset

One or more items are grouped together and are surrounded by
brackets to indicate that they form a set, or more specifically,
an itemset that appears in the data with some regularity. For
example, in Table 9.3, {Bread, Milk, Egg} can be grouped
together to form an itemset as those are frequently bought
together. To generalize this concept, if I = {i , i ,�, i } are the
items in a market basket data and T = {t , t ,�, t } are the set
of all the transactions, then each transaction t  contains a
subset of items from I. A collection of zero or more items is

1

n

2

2

n

1

i

called an itemset. A null itemset is the one which does not
contain any item. In the association analysis, an itemset is
called k-itemset if it contains k number of items. Thus, the
itemset {Bread, Milk, Egg} is a three-itemset.

Table 9.3 Market Basket Transaction Data

9.5.1.2 Support count

Support count denotes the number of transactions in which a
particular itemset is present. This is a very important property
of an itemset as it denotes the frequency of occurrence for the
itemset. This is expressed as

where |{}| denotes the number of elements in a set

In Table 9.3, the itemset {Bread, Milk, Egg} occurs
together three times and thus have a support count of 3.

9.5.2 Association rule

The result of the market basket analysis is expressed as a set of
association rules that specify patterns of relationships among
items. A typical rule might be expressed as{Bread, Milk}
?{Egg}, which denotes that if Bread and Milk are purchased,
then Egg is also likely to be purchased. Thus, association rules
are learned from subsets of itemsets. For example, the
preceding rule was identified from the set of {Bread, Milk,
Egg}.

It should be noted that an association rule is an expression
of X ? Y where X and Y are disjoint itemsets, i.e. X ? Y = 0.

Support and confidence are the two concepts that are used

for measuring the strength of an association rule. Support
denotes how often a rule is applicable to a given data set.
Confidence indicates how often the items in Y appear in
transactions that contain X in a total transaction of N.
Confidence denotes the predictive power or accuracy of the
rule. So, the mathematical expressions are

In our data set 9.3, if we consider the association rule

{Bread, Milk} ? {Egg}, then from the above formula

It is important to understand the role of support and
confidence in the association analysis. A low support may
indicate that the rule has occurred by chance. Also, from its
application perspective, this rule may not be a very attractive
business investment as the items are seldom bought together
by the customers. Thus, support can provide the intelligence of
identifying the most interesting rules for analysis.

Similarly, confidence provides the measurement for
reliability of the inference of a rule. Higher confidence of a
rule X ? Y denotes more likelihood of to be present in
transactions that contain X as it is the estimate of the
conditional probability of Y given X.

Also, understand that the confidence of X leading to Y is not

the same as the confidence of Y leading to X. In our example,
confidence of {Bread, Milk} ? {Egg} = 0.75 but confidence

of

 Here, the rule {Bread,

Milk} ? {Egg} is the strong rule.

Association rules were developed in the context of Big Data
and data science and are not used for prediction. They are used
for unsupervised knowledge discovery in large databases,
unlike the classification and numeric prediction algorithms.
Still we will find that association rule learners are closely
related to and share many features of the classification rule
learners. As association rule learners are unsupervised, there is
no need for the algorithm to be trained; this means that no
prior labelling of the data is required. The programme is
simply run on a data set in the hope that interesting
associations are found.

Obviously, the downside is that there is not an easy way to

objectively measure the performance of a rule learner, aside
from evaluating them for qualitative usefulness. Also, note
that the association rule analysis is used to search for
interesting connections among a very large number of
variables. Though human beings are capable of such insight
quite intuitively, sometimes it requires expert-level knowledge
or a great deal of experience to achieve the performance of a
rule-learning algorithm. Additionally, some data may be too
large or complex for humans to decipher and analyse so easily.

9.5.3 The apriori algorithm for association rule learning

As discussed earlier, the main challenge of discovering an
association rule and learning from it is the large volume of
transactional data and the related complexity. Because of the
variation of features in transactional data, the number of
feature sets within a data set usually becomes very large. This
leads to the problem of handling a very large number of
itemsets, which grows exponentially with the number of
features. If there are k items which may or may not be part of
an itemset, then there is 2  ways of creating itemsets with

k

those items. For example, if a seller is dealing with 100
different items, then the learner need to evaluate 2
itemsets for arriving at the rule, which is computationally
impossible. So, it is important to filter out the most important
(and thus manageable in size) itemsets and use the resources
on those to arrive at the reasonably efficient association rules.

 = 1 � e

100

30

The first step for us is to decide the minimum support and
minimum confidence of the association rules. From a set of
transaction T, let us assume that we will find out all the rules
that have support ? minS and confidence ? minC, where minS
and minC are the support and confidence thresholds,
respectively, for the rules to be considered acceptable. Now,
even if we put the minS = 20% and minC = 50%, it is seen that
more than 80% of the rules are discarded; this means that a
large portion of the computational efforts could have been
avoided if the itemsets for consideration were first pruned and
the itemsets which cannot generate association rules with
reasonable support and confidence were removed. The
approach to achieve this goal is discussed below.

Step 1: decouple the support and confidence requirements.

According to formula 9.8, the support of the rule X ? Y is
dependent only on the support of its corresponding itemsets.
For example, all the below rules have the same support as their
itemsets are the same {Bread, Milk, Egg}:

{Bread, Milk} ? {Egg}
{Bread, Egg} ? {Milk}
{Egg, Milk} ? {Bread}
{Bread} ? {Egg, Milk}
{Milk} ? {Bread, Egg}
{Egg} ? {Bread, Milk}

So, the same treatment can be applied to this association
rule on the basis of the frequency of the itemset. In this case, if

the itemset {Bread, Milk, Egg} is rare in the basket
transactions, then all these six rules can be discarded without
computing their individual support and confidence values.
This identifies some important strategies for arriving at the
association rules:

1. Generate Frequent Itemset: Once the minS is set for a particular

assignment, identify all the itemsets that satisfy minS. These itemsets
are called frequent itemsets.

2. Generate Rules: From the frequent itemsets found in the previous step,
discover all the high confidence rules. These are called strong rules.

Please note that the computation requirement for identifying
frequent itemsets is more intense than the rule generation. So,
different techniques have been evolved to optimize the
performance for frequent itemset generation as well as rule
discovery as discussed in the next section.

9.5.4 Build the apriori principle rules

One of the most widely used algorithm to reduce the number
of itemsets to search for the association rule is known as
Apriori. It has proven to be successful in simplifying the
association rule learning to a great extent. The principle got its
name from the fact that the algorithm utilizes a simple prior
belief (i.e. a priori) about the properties of frequent itemsets:

If an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be
frequent.

This principle significantly restricts the number of itemsets
to be searched for rule generation. For example, if in a market
basket analysis, it is found that an item like �Salt� is not so
frequently bought along with the breakfast items, then it is fine
to remove all the itemsets containing salt for rule generation as

their contribution to the support and confidence of the rule will
be insignificant.

The converse also holds true:

If an itemset is frequent, then all the supersets must be
frequent too.

These are very powerful principles which help in pruning
the exponential search space based on the support measure and
is known as support-based pruning. The key property of the
support measure used here is that the support for an itemset
never exceeds the support for its subsets. This is also known as
the anti-monotone property of the support measure.

Let us use the transaction data in Table 9.3 to illustrate the
Apriori principle and its use. From the full itemset of six items
{Bread, Milk, Egg, Butter, Salt, Apple}, there are 2  ways to
create baskets or itemsets (including the null itemset) as shown
in Figure 9.15:

6

FIG. 9.15 Sixty-four ways to create itemsets from 6 items

Without applying any filtering logic, the brute-force

approach would involve calculating the support count for each
itemset in Figure 9.16. Thus, by comparing each item in the
generated itemset with the actual transactions mentioned in
Table 9.3, we can determine the support count of the itemset.
For example, if {Bread, Milk} is present in any transactions in
Table 9.3, then its support count will be incremented by 1. As
we can understand, this is a very computation heavy activity,
and as discussed earlier, many of the computations may get
wasted at a later point of time because some itemsets will be
found to be infrequent in the transactions. To get an idea of the
total computations to be done, the number of comparisons to
be done is T � N � L, where T is the number of transactions (6
in our case), N is the number of candidate itemsets (64 in our
case), and L is the maximum transaction width (6 in our case).

FIG. 9.16 Discarding the itemsets consisting of Salt

Let us apply the Apriori principle on this data set to reduce
the number of candidate itemsets (N). We could identify from
the transaction Table 9.3 that Salt is an infrequent item. So, by

applying the Apriori principle, we can say that all the itemsets
which are superset of Salt will be infrequent and thus can be
discarded from comparison to discover the association rule as
shown in Figure 9.16.

This approach reduces the computation effort for a good
number of itemsets and will make our search process more
efficient. Thus, in each such iteration, we can determine the
support count of each itemset, and on the basis of the min
support value fixed for our analysis, any itemset in the
hierarchy that does not meet the min support criteria can be
discarded to make the rule generation faster and easier.

To generalize the example in order to build a set of rules
with the Apriori principle, we will use the Apriori principle
that states that all subsets of a frequent itemset must also be
frequent. In other words, if {X, Y} is frequent, then both {X}
and {Y} must be frequent. Also by definition, the support
metric indicates how frequently an itemset appears in the data.
Thus, if we know that {X} does not meet a desired support
threshold, there is no reason to consider {X, Y} or any itemset
containing {X}; it cannot possibly be frequent.

This logic of the Apriori algorithm excludes potential

association rules prior to actually evaluating them. The actual
process of creating rules involves two phases:

Identifying all itemsets that meet a minimum support threshold set for the
analysis
Creating rules from these itemsets that meet a minimum confidence
threshold which identifies the strong rules

The first phase involves multiple iterations where each

successive iteration requires evaluating the support of storing a
set of increasingly large itemsets. For instance, iteration 1

evaluates the set of one-item itemsets (one-itemsets), iteration
2 involves evaluating the two-itemsets, etc.. The result of each
iteration N is a set of all N-itemsets that meet the minimum
support threshold. Normally, all the itemsets from iteration N
are combined in order to generate candidate itemsets for
evaluation in iteration N + 1, but by applying the Apriori
principle, we can eliminate some of them even before the next
iteration starts. If {X}, {Y}, and {Z} are frequent in iteration 1
while {W} is not frequent, then iteration 2 will consider only
{X, Y}, {X, Z}, and {Y, Z}. We can see that the algorithm
needs to evaluate only three itemsets rather than the six that
would have been evaluated if sets containing W had not been
eliminated by apriori.

By continuing with the iterations, let us assume that during
iteration 2, it is discovered that {X, Y} and {Y, Z} are frequent,
but {X, Z} is not. Although iteration 3 would normally begin
by evaluating the support for {X, Y, Z}, this step need not
occur at all. The Apriori principle states that {X, Y, Z} cannot
be frequent, because the subset {X, Z} is not. Therefore, in
iteration 3, the algorithm may stop as no new itemset can be
generated.

Once we identify the qualifying itemsets for analysis, the
second phase of the Apriori algorithm begins. For the given set
of frequent itemsets, association rules are generated from all
possible subsets. For example, {X, Y} would result in
candidate rules for {X} ? {Y} and {Y} ? {X}. These rules
are evaluated against a minimum confidence threshold, and
any rule that does not meet the desired confidence level is
eliminated, thus finally yielding the set of strong rules.

Though the Apriori principle is widely used in the market
basket analysis and other applications of association rule help

in the discovery of new relationship among objects, there are
certain strengths and weaknesses we need to keep in mind
before employing it over the target data set:

9.6 SUMMARY

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning concept where the unlabelled
and unclassified information is analysed to discover hidden knowledge. The
algorithm works on the data without any prior training, but they are
constructed in such a way that they can identify patterns, groupings, sorting
order, and numerous other interesting knowledge from the set of data.
Clustering refers to a broad set of techniques for finding subgroups, or
clusters, in a data set based on the characteristics of the objects within the
data set itself in such a manner that the objects within the group are similar
(or related to each other) but are different from (or unrelated to) the objects
from the other groups.
The major clustering techniques are classified in three board categories

Partitioning methods,
Hierarchical methods, and
Density-based methods.

k-means and k-medoids are the most popular partitioning techniques.
The principle of k-means algorithm is to assign each of the n data points to
one of the k clusters, where k is a user-defined parameter as the number of
clusters desired. The objective is to maximize the homogeneity within the
clusters and to maximize the differences between the clusters. The
homogeneity and differences are measured in terms of the distance between
the points.
k-medoids considers representative data points from the existing points in the
data set as the centre of the clusters. It then assigns the data points according
to their distance from these centres to form the clusters.

The hierarchical clustering methods are used to group the data into hierarchy
or tree-like structure.
There are two main hierarchical clustering methods: agglomerative
clustering and divisive clustering. Agglomerative clustering is a bottom-up
technique which starts with individual objects as clusters and then iteratively
merges them to form larger clusters. On the other hand, the divisive method
starts with one cluster with all given objects and then splits it iteratively to
form smaller clusters.
DBSCAN is one of the density-based clustering approaches that provide a
solution to identify clusters of arbitrary shapes. The principle is based on
identifying the dense area and sparse area within the data set and then
running the clustering algorithm.
Association rule presents a methodology that is useful for identifying
interesting relationships hidden in large data sets. It is also known as
association analysis, and the discovered relationships can be represented in
the form of association rules comprising a set of frequent items.
A common application of this analysis is the Market Basket Analysis that
retailers use for cross-selling of their products.

Basics of Neural Network

OBJECTIVE OF THE CHAPTER :

In the last 9 chapters, you have been introduced to the
concepts of machine learning in great details. You started
with how to decide whether a problem can be solved with
machine learning, and once you have made that decision,
you learnt how to start with the modelling of the problem
in the machine learning paradigm. In that context, you
were introduced to three types of machine learning �
supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement. Then, you
explored all different popular algorithms of supervised and
unsupervised learning. Now, you have gained quite some
background on machine learning basics, and it is time for
you to get introduced to the concept of neural network.

Well, you have already seen right at the beginning of the

book how the machine learning process maps with the
human learning process. Now, it is time to see how the
human nervous system has been mimicked in the computer
world in the form of an artificial neural network or simply
a neural network. This chapter gives a brief view of neural
networks and how it helps in different forms of learning.

10.1 INTRODUCTION

In the previous chapters, we were slowly unveiling the
mystery of machine learning, i.e. how a machine learns to
perform tasks and improves with time from experience, by
expert guidance or by itself. Machine learning, as we have
seen, mimics the human form of learning. On the other hand,
human learning, or for that matter every action of a human
being, is controlled by the nervous system. In any human
being, the nervous system coordinates the different actions by
transmitting signals to and from different parts of the body.
The nervous system is constituted of a special type of cell,
called neuron or nerve cell, which has special structures
allowing it to receive or send signals to other neurons.
Neurons connect with each other to transmit signals to or
receive signals from other neurons. This structure essentially
forms a network of neurons or a neural network.

By virtue of billions of networked neurons that it possesses,
the biological neural network is a massively large and complex
parallel computing network. It is because of this massive
parallel computing network that the nervous system helps
human beings to perform actions or take decisions at a speed
and with such ease that the fastest supercomputer of the world
will also be envy of. For example, let us think of the superb
flying catches taken by the fielders in the cricket world cup. It
is a combination of superior calculation based on past
cricketing experience, understanding of local on-ground
conditions, and anticipation of how hard the ball has been hit
that the fielder takes the decision about when to jump, where
to jump, and how much to jump. This is a highly complex
task, and you may think that not every human being is skilled
enough for such a magical action. In that case, let us think of

something much simpler. Let us consider about a very simple,
daily activity, namely swimming in the pool. Apparently,
swimming may look very trivial, but think about the parallel
actions and decisions that need to be taken to swim. It needs
the right combination of body position, limb movement,
breathe in/out, etc. to swim. To add to the challenge is the fact
that water is few hundred times denser than air. So, to orient
the body movement in that scale difference is a difficult
proposition in itself. Coordinating the actions and taking the
decisions for such a complex task, which may appear to be
trivial, are possible because of the massive parallel complex
network, i.e. the neural network.

The fascinating capability of the biological neural network
has inspired the inception of artificial neural network (ANN).
An ANN is made up of artificial neurons. In its most generic
form, an ANN is a machine designed to model the functioning
of the nervous system or, more specifically, the neurons. The
only difference is that the biological form of neuron is
replicated in the electronic or digital form of neuron. Digital
neurons or artificial neurons form the smallest processing units
of the ANNs. As we move on, let us first do a deep dive into
the structure of the biological neuron and then try to see how
that has been modelled in the artificial neuron.

10.2 UNDERSTANDING THE BIOLOGICAL NEURON

The human nervous system has two main parts �

the central nervous system (CNS) consisting of the brain and spinal cord
the peripheral nervous system consisting of nerves and ganglia outside the
brain and spinal cord.

The CNS integrates all information, in the form of signals,

from the different parts of the body. The peripheral nervous
system, on the other hand, connects the CNS with the limbs

and organs. Neurons are basic structural units of the CNS. A
neuron is able to receive, process, and transmit information in
the form of chemical and electrical signals. Figure 10.1
presents the structure of a neuron. It has three main parts to
carry out its primary functionality of receiving and
transmitting information:

1. Dendrites � to receive signals from neighbouring neurons.
2. Soma � main body of the neuron which accumulates the signals coming
from the different dendrites. It �fires� when a sufficient amount of signal
is accumulated.

3. Axon � last part of the neuron which receives signal from soma, once

the neuron �fires�, and passes it on to the neighbouring neurons through
the axon terminals (to the adjacent dendrite of the neighbouring
neurons).

There is a very small gap between the axon terminal of one
neuron and the adjacent dendrite of the neighbouring neuron.
This small gap is known as synapse. The signals transmitted
through synapse may be excitatory or inhibitory.

FIG. 10.1 Structure of biological neuron

Points to Ponder:

3

11

The adult human brain, which forms the main part of the
central nervous system, is approximately 1.3 kg in weight
and 1200 cm  in volume. It is estimated to contain about
100 billion (i.e. 10 ) neurons and 10 times more glial or
glue cells. Glial cells act as support cells for the neurons. It
is believed that neurons represent about 10% of all cells in
5
the brain. On an average, each neuron is connected to 10
of other neurons, which means that altogether there are
10  connections.

16

The axon, a human neuron, is 10�12 ?m in diameter.
Each synapse spans a gap of about a millionth of an inch
wide.

10.3 EXPLORING THE ARTIFICIAL NEURON

The biological neural network has been modelled in the form
of ANN with artificial neurons simulating the function of
biological neurons. As depicted in Figure 10.2, input signal x
i
(x , x , �, x ) comes to an artificial neuron. Each neuron has
n
three major components:

1

2

1. A set of �i� synapses having weight w . A signal x  forms the input to the i-th
i

i

synapse having weight w . The value of weight w  may be positive or
negative. A positive weight has an excitatory effect, while a negative weight
has an inhibitory effect on the output of the summation junction, y

i

i

.
sum

2. A summation junction for the input signals is weighted by the respective
synaptic weight. Because it is a linear combiner or adder of the weighted
input signals, the output of the summation junction, y
follows:

, can be expressed as

sum

[Note:  Typically,  a  neural  network  also  includes  a  bias  which  adjusts  the
input of the activation function. However, for the sake of simplicity, we are
ignoring bias for the time being. In the case of a bias �b�, the value of y
would have been as follows:

sum

3. A threshold activation function (or simply activation function, also called
squashing function) results in an output signal only when an input signal
exceeding a specific threshold value comes as an input. It is similar in
behaviour to the biological neuron which transmits the signal only when the
total input signal meets the firing threshold.

FIG. 10.2 Structure of an artificial neuron

Output of the activation function, y

, can be expressed as

out

follows:

10.4 TYPES OF ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS

There are different types of activation functions. The most
commonly used activation functions are highlighted below.

10.4.1 Identity function

Identity function is used as an activation function for the input
layer. It is a linear function having the form

As obvious, the output remains the same as the input.

10.4.2 Threshold/step function

Step/threshold function is a commonly used activation
function. As depicted in Figure 10.3a, step function gives 1 as
output if the input is either 0 or positive. If the input is
negative, the step function gives 0 as output. Expressing
mathematically,

FIG. 10.3 Step and threshold functions

The threshold function (depicted in Fig. 10.3b) is almost
like the step function, with the only difference being the fact
that ? is used as a threshold value instead of 0. Expressing
mathematically,

10.4.3 ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function

ReLU is the most popularly used activation function in the
areas of convolutional neural networks and deep learning. It is
of the form

This means that f(x) is zero when x is less than zero and f(x)

is equal to x when x is above or equal to zero. Figure 10.4
depicts the curve for a ReLU activation function.

FIG. 10.4 ReLU function

This function is differentiable, except at a single point x = 0.

In that sense, the derivative of a ReLU is actually a sub-
derivative.

10.4.4 Sigmoid function

Sigmoid function, depicted in Figure 10.5, is by far the most
commonly used activation function in neural networks. The
need for sigmoid function stems from the fact that many
learning algorithms require the activation function to be
differentiable and hence continuous. Step function is not
suitable in those situations as it is not continuous. There are
two types of sigmoid function:

1. Binary sigmoid function
2. Bipolar sigmoid function

10.4.4.1 Binary sigmoid function

A binary sigmoid function, depicted in Figure 10.5a, is of the
form

where k = steepness or slope parameter of the sigmoid
function. By varying the value of k, sigmoid functions with
different slopes can be obtained. It has range of (0, 1).

FIG. 10.5 Sigmoid function

The slope at origin is k/4. As the value of k becomes very

large, the sigmoid function becomes a threshold function.

10.4.4.2 Bipolar sigmoid function

A bipolar sigmoid function, depicted in Figure 10.5b, is of the
form

The range of values of sigmoid functions can be varied
depending on the application. However, the range of (?1, +1)
is most commonly adopted.

10.4.5 Hyperbolic tangent function

Hyperbolic tangent function is another continuous activation
function, which is bipolar in nature. It is a widely adopted
activation function for a special type of neural network known
as backpropagation network (discussed elaborately in Section
10.8). The hyperbolic tangent function is of the form

This function is similar to the bipolar sigmoid function.

Note that all the activation functions defined in Sections

10.4.2 and 10.4.4 have values ranging between 0 and 1.
However, in some cases, it is desirable to have values ranging
from ?1 to +1. In that case, there will be a need to reframe the
activation function. For example, in the case of step function,
the revised definition would be as follows:

Did you know?

Works related to neural network dates long back to the
1940s. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943 created
a computational network inspired by the biological
processes in the brain. This model paved the way for
neural networks.

The next notable work in the area of neural network was

in the late 1940s by the Canadian psychologist Donald
Olding Hebb. He proposed a learning hypothesis based on
the neurons and synaptic connection between neurons.
This became popular as Hebbian learning.

In 1958, the American psychologist Frank Rosenblatt
refined the Hebbian concept and evolved the concept of
perceptron. It was almost at the same time, in 1960, that
Professor Bernard Widrow of Stanford University came up
with an early single-layer ANN named ADALINE
(Adaptive Linear Neuron or later Adaptive Linear
Element). Marvin Lee Minsky and Seymour Aubrey
Papert stated two key issues of perceptron in their research
paper in 1969. The first issue stated was the
inability of perceptron of processing the XOR (exclusive-
OR) circuit. The other issue was lack of processing power
of computers to effectively handle the large neural
networks.

From here till the middle of the 1970s, there was a

slowdown in the research work related to neural networks.
There was a renewed interest generated in neural networks
and learning with Werbos� backpropagation algorithm in
1975. Slowly, as the computing ability of the computers
increased drastically, a lot of research on neural network
has been conducted in the later decades. Neural network

evolved further as deep neural networks and started to be
implemented in solving large-scale learning problems such
as image recognition, thereby getting a more popular name
as deep learning.

10.5 EARLY IMPLEMENTATIONS OF ANN

10.5.1 McCulloch�Pitts model of neuron

The McCulloch�Pitts neural model (depicted in Fig. 10.6),
which was the earliest ANN model, has only two types of
inputs � excitatory and inhibitory. The excitatory inputs have
weights of positive magnitude and the inhibitory weights have
weights of negative magnitude. The inputs of the McCulloch�
Pitts neuron could be either 0 or 1. It has a threshold function
as activation function. So, the output signal y
input y
else 0.

 is greater than or equal to a given threshold value,

 is 1 if the

sum

out

Simple McCulloch�Pitts neurons can be used to design
logical operations. For that purpose, the connection weights
need to be correctly decided along with the threshold function
(rather the threshold value of the activation function). Let us
take a small example.

FIG. 10.6 McCulloch�Pitts neuron

John carries an umbrella if it is sunny or if it is raining.
There are four given situations. We need to decide when John
will carry the umbrella. The situations are as follows:

Situation 1 � It is not raining nor is it sunny.
Situation 2 � It is not raining, but it is sunny.
Situation 3 � It is raining, and it is not sunny.
Situation 4 � Wow, it is so strange! It is raining as well as it is sunny.

To analyse the situations using the McCulloch�Pitts neural

model, we can consider the input signals as follows:

x  ? Is it raining?
1
x  ? Is it sunny?
2

So, the value of both x  and x  can be either 0 or 1. We can
2

1

use the value of both weights x  and x  as 1 and a threshold
1
value of the activation function as 1. So, the neural model will
look as Figure 10.7a.

2

FIG. 10.7 McCulloch�Pitts neural model (illustration)

Formally, we can say,

The truth table built with respect to the problem is depicted
in Figure 10.7b. From the truth table, we can conclude that in
the situations where the value of y
 is 1, John needs to carry
an umbrella. Hence, he will need to carry an umbrella in
situations 2, 3, and 4. Surprised, as it looks like a typical logic
problem related to �OR� function? Do not worry, it is really an
implementation of logical OR using the McCulloch�Pitts
neural model.

out

10.5.2 Rosenblatt�s perceptron

Rosenblatt�s perceptron is built around the McCulloch�Pitts
neural model. The perceptron, as depicted in Figure 10.7,
receives a set of input x , x ,�, x . The linear combiner or the
adder node computes the linear combination of the inputs
applied to the synapses with synaptic weights being w , w ,
2
�, w . Then, the hard limiter checks whether the resulting

n

1

2

1

n

sum is positive or negative. If the input of the hard limiter
node is positive, the output is +1, and if the input is negative,
the output is ?1. Mathematically, the hard limiter input is

However, perceptron includes an adjustable value or bias as
an additional weight w . This additional weight w  is attached
to a dummy input x , which is always assigned a value of 1.
This consideration modifies the above equation to

0

0

0

The output is decided by the expression

The objective of perceptron is to classify a set of inputs into

1

2

two classes, c  and c . This can be done using a very simple
decision rule � assign the inputs x , x , x , �, x  to c  if the
output of the perceptron, i.e. y
for an n-dimensional signal space, i.e. a space for �n� input
signals x , x , x , �, x , the simplest form of perceptron will
have two decision regions, resembling two classes, separated
by a hyperplane defined by

n
2
0
, is +1 and c  if y

1
 is ?1. So,

FIG. 10.8 Rosenblatt�s perceptron

Therefore, for two input signals denoted by variables x  and

1

x , the decision boundary is a straight line of the form
2

So, for a perceptron having the values of synaptic weights

0

w , w , and w  as ?2, �, and �, respectively, the linear
decision boundary will be of the form

1

2

So, any point (x , x ) which lies above the decision

1

2

boundary, as depicted by Figure 10.9, will be assigned to class
c  and the points which lie below the boundary are assigned to
1
class c .
2

FIG. 10.9 Perceptron decision boundary

Let us examine if this perceptron is able to classify a set of

points given below:

p  = (5, 2) and p  = (?1, 12) belonging to c
1
1

2

p  = (3, ?5) and p  = (?2, ?1) belonging to c
2
3

4

As depicted in Figure 10.10, we can see that on the basis of

activation function output, only points p  and p  generate an
output of 1. Hence, they are assigned to class c  as expected.
On the other hand, p  and p  points having activation function
output as negative generate an output of 0. Hence, they are
assigned to class c , again as expected.

The same classification is obtained by mapping the points in

the input space, as shown in Figure 10.11.

FIG. 10.11 Classification by decision boundary

Thus, we can see that for a data set with linearly separable

classes, perceptrons can always be employed to solve
classification problems using decision lines (for two-
dimensional space), decision planes (for three-dimensional
space), or decision hyperplanes (for n-dimensional space).

Appropriate values of the synaptic weights w , w , w , �,

w  can be obtained by training a perceptron. However, one
assumption for perceptron to work properly is that the two
classes should be linearly separable (as depicted in Figure
10.12a), i.e. the classes should be sufficiently separated from
each other. Otherwise, if the classes are non-linearly separable
(as depicted in Figure 10.12b), then the classification problem
cannot be solved by perceptron.

FIG. 10.12 Class separability

10.5.2.1 Multi-layer perceptron

A basic perceptron works very successfully for data sets which
possess linearly separable patterns. However, in practical
situation, that is an ideal situation to have. This was exactly
the point driven by Minsky and Papert in their work (1969).
They showed that a basic perceptron is not able to learn to
compute even a simple 2-bit XOR. Why is that so? Let us try
to understand.

Figure 10.13 is the truth table highlighting output of a 2-bit

XOR function.

FIG. 10.13 Class separability of XOR function output

As we can see in Figure 10.13, the data is not linearly
separable. Only a curved decision boundary can separate the
classes properly.

To address this issue, the other option is to use two decision
lines in place of one. Figure 10.14 shows how a linear decision
boundary with two decision lines can clearly partition the data.

FIG. 10.14 Classification with two decision lines in XOR function output

This is the philosophy used to design the multi-layer
perceptron model. The major highlights of this model are as
follows:

The neural network contains one or more intermediate layers between the
input and the output nodes, which are hidden from both input and output
nodes.
Each neuron in the network includes a non-linear activation function that is
differentiable.
The neurons in each layer are connected with some or all the neurons in the
previous layer.

The diagram in Figure 10.15 resembles a fully connected
multi-layer perceptron with multiple hidden layers between the
input and output layers. It is called fully connected because
any neuron in any layer of the perceptron is connected with all
neurons (or input nodes in the case of the first hidden layer) in
the previous layer. The signals flow from one layer to another
layer from left to right.

10.5.3 ADALINE network model

Adaptive Linear Neural Element (ADALINE) is an early
single-layer ANN developed by Professor Bernard Widrow of
Stanford University. As depicted in Figure 10.16, it has only
output neuron. The output value can be +1 or ?1. A bias input
x  (where x  = 1) having a weight w  is added. The activation
0
function is such that if the weighted sum is positive or 0, then
the output is 1, else it is ?1. Formally, we can say,

0

0

FIG. 10.15 Multi-layer perceptron

FIG. 10.16 ADALINE network

The supervised learning algorithm adopted by the

ADALINE network is known as Least Mean Square (LMS) or
Delta rule.

A network combining a number of ADALINEs is termed as
MADALINE (many ADALINE). MADALINE networks can
be used to solve problems related to nonlinear separability.

Note:

Both perceptron and ADALINE are neural network
models. Both of them are classifiers for binary
classification. They have linear decision boundary and use
a threshold activation function.

10.6 ARCHITECTURES OF NEURAL NETWORK

As we have seen till now, ANN is a computational system
consisting of a large number of interconnected units called

artificial neurons. The connection between artificial neurons
can transmit signal from one neuron to another. There are
multiple possibilities for connecting the neurons based on
which architecture we are going to adopt for a specific
solution. Some of the choices are listed below:

There may be just two layers of neuron in the network � the input and output
layer.
Other than the input and output layers, there may be one or more
intermediate �hidden� layers of neuron.
The neurons may be connected with one or more of the neurons in the next
layer.
The neurons may be connected with all neurons in the next layer.
There may be single or multiple output signals. If there are multiple output
signals, they might be connected with each other.
The output from one layer may become input to neurons in the same or
preceding layer.

10.6.1 Single-layer feed forward network

Single-layer feed forward is the simplest and most basic
architecture of ANNs. It consists of only two layers as
depicted in Figure 10.17 � the input layer and the output layer.
The input layer consists of a set of �m� input neurons X , X ,
2
�, X  connected to each of the �n� output neurons Y , Y , �,
Y . The connections carry weights w , w , �, w . The input
layer of neurons does not conduct any processing � they pass
the input signals to the output neurons. The computations are
performed only by the neurons in the output layer. So, though
it has two layers of neurons, only one layer is performing the
computation. This is the reason why the network is known as
single layer in spite of having two layers of neurons. Also, the
signals always flow from the input layer to the output layer.
Hence, this network is known as feed forward.

The multi-layer feed forward network is quite similar to the
single-layer feed forward network, except for the fact that
there are one or more intermediate layers of neurons between
the input and the output layers. Hence, the network is termed
as multi-layer. The structure of this network is depicted in
Figure 10.18.

FIG. 10.18 Multi-layer feed forward

Each of the layers may have varying number of neurons.
For example, the one shown in Figure 10.18 has �m� neurons
in the input layer and �r� neurons in the output layer, and there
is only one hidden layer with �n� neurons.

The net signal input to the neuron in the hidden layer is

given by

for the k-th hidden layer neuron. The net signal input to the

neuron in the output layer is given by

for the k-th output layer neuron.

10.6.3 Competitive network

The competitive network is almost the same in structure as the
single-layer feed forward network. The only difference is that
the output neurons are connected with each other (either
partially or fully). Figure 10.19 depicts a fully connected
competitive network.

FIG. 10.19 Competitive network

In competitive networks, for a given input, the output

neurons compete amongst themselves to represent the input. It
represents a form of unsupervised learning algorithm in ANN
that is suitable to find clusters in a data set.

10.6.4 Recurrent network

We have seen that in feed forward networks, signals always
flow from the input layer towards the output layer (through the
hidden layers in the case of multi-layer feed forward
networks), i.e. in one direction. In the case of recurrent neural
networks, there is a small deviation. There is a feedback loop,

as depicted in Figure 10.20, from the neurons in the output
layer to the input layer neurons. There may also be self-loops.

FIG. 10.20 Recurrent neural network

10.7 LEARNING PROCESS IN ANN

Now that we have a clear idea about neurons, how they form
networks using different architectures, what is activation
function in a neuron, and what are the different choices of
activation functions, it is time to relate all these to our main
focus, i.e. learning. First, we need to understand what is
learning in the context of ANNs? There are four major aspects
which need to be decided:

1. The number of layers in the network
2. The direction of signal flow
3. The number of nodes in each layer
4. The value of weights attached with each interconnection between neurons

10.7.1 Number of layers

As we have seen earlier, a neural network may have a single
layer or multi-layer. In the case of a single layer, a set of
neurons in the input layer receives signal, i.e. a single feature
per neuron, from the data set. The value of the feature is
transformed by the activation function of the input neuron. The
signals processed by the neurons in the input layer are then
forwarded to the neurons in the output layer. The neurons in
the output layer use their own activation function to generate
the final prediction.

More complex networks may be designed with multiple
hidden layers between the input layer and the output layer.
Most of the multi-layer networks are fully connected.

10.7.2 Direction of signal flow

In certain networks, termed as feed forward networks, signal is
always fed in one direction, i.e. from the input layer towards
the output layer through the hidden layers, if there is any.
However, certain networks, such as the recurrent network, also
allow signals to travel from the output layer to the input layer.

This is also an important consideration for choosing the

correct learning model.

10.7.3 Number of nodes in layers

In the case of a multi-layer network, the number of nodes in
each layer can be varied. However, the number of nodes or
neurons in the input layer is equal to the number of features of
the input data set. Similarly, the number of output nodes will
depend on possible outcomes, e.g. number of classes in the
case of supervised learning. So, the number of nodes in each

of the hidden layers is to be chosen by the user. A larger
number of nodes in the hidden layer help in improving the
performance. However, too many nodes may result in
overfitting as well as an increased computational expense.

10.7.4 Weight of interconnection between neurons

Deciding the value of weights attached with each
interconnection between neurons so that a specific learning
problem can be solved correctly is quite a difficult problem by
itself. Let us try to understand it in the context of a problem.
Let us take a step back and look at the problem in Section
10.6.2.

We have a set of points with known labels as given below.
We have to train an ANN model using this data, so that it can
classify a new test data, say p  (3, ?2).

5

p  = (5, 2) and p  = (?1, 12) belonging to c
1
1
p  = (3, ?5) and p  = (?2, ?1) belonging to c
2
3

4

2

When we were discussing the problem in Section 10.6.2, we

assumed the values of the synaptic weights w , w , and w  as
2
?2, �, and �, respectively. But where on earth did we get
those values from? Will we get these weight values for every
learning problem that we will attempt to solve using ANN?
The answer is a big NO.

1

0

For solving a learning problem using ANN, we can start
with a set of values for the synaptic weights and keep doing
changes to those values in multiple iterations. In the case of
supervised learning, the objective to be pursued is to reduce
the number of misclassifications. Ideally, the iterations for
making changes in weight values should be continued till there
is no misclassification. However, in practice, such a stopping

criterion may not be possible to achieve. Practical stopping
criteria may be the rate of misclassification less than a specific
threshold value, say 1%, or the maximum number of iterations
reaches a threshold, say 25, etc. There may be other practical
challenges to deal with, such as the rate of misclassification is
not reducing progressively. This may become a bigger
problem when the number of interconnections and hence the
number of weights keeps increasing. There are ways to deal
with those challenges, which we will see in more details in the
next section.

So, to summarize, learning process using ANN is a
combination of multiple aspects � which include deciding the
number of hidden layers, number of nodes in each of the
hidden layers, direction of signal flow, and last but not the
least, deciding the connection weights.

Multi-layer feed forward network is a commonly adopted
architecture. It has been observed that a neural network with
even one hidden layer can be used to reasonably approximate
any continuous function. The learning method adopted to train
a multi-layer feed forward network is termed as
backpropagation, which we will study in the next section.

10.8 BACK PROPAGATION

We have already seen that one of the most critical activities of
training an ANN is to assign the inter-neuron connection
weights. It can be a very intense work, more so for the neural
networks having a high number of hidden layers or a high
number of nodes in a layer. In 1986, an efficient method of
training an ANN was discovered. In this method, errors, i.e.
difference in output values of the output layer and the expected
values, are propagated back from the output layer to the
preceding layers. Hence, the algorithm implementing this

method is known as backpropagation, i.e. propagating the
errors backward to the preceding layers.

The backpropagation algorithm is applicable for multi-layer

feed forward networks. It is a supervised learning algorithm
which continues adjusting the weights of the connected
neurons with an objective to reduce the deviation of the output
signal from the target output. This algorithm consists of
multiple iterations, also known as epochs. Each epoch consists
of two phases �

A forward phase in which the signals flow from the neurons in the input
layer to the neurons in the output layer through the hidden layers. The
weights of the interconnections and activation functions are used during the
flow. In the output layer, the output signals are generated.
A backward phase in which the output signal is compared with the expected
value. The computed errors are propagated backwards from the output to the
preceding layers. The errors propagated back are used to adjust the
interconnection weights between the layers.

The iterations continue till a stopping criterion is reached.

Figure 10.21 depicts a reasonably simplified version of the
backpropagation algorithm.

One main part of the algorithm is adjusting the

interconnection weights. This is done using a technique termed
as gradient descent. In simple terms, the algorithm calculates
the partial derivative of the activation function by each
interconnection weight to identify the �gradient� or extent of
change of the weight required to minimize the cost function.
Quite understandably, therefore, the activation function needs
to be differentiable. Let us try to understand this in a bit more
details.

FIG. 10.21 Backpropagation algorithm

Points to Ponder:

A real-world simile for the gradient descent algorithm is a
blind person trying to come down from a hill top without
anyone to assist. The person is not able to see. So, for the
person who is not able to see the path of descent, the only

option is to check in which direction the land slope feels to
be downward. One challenge of this approach arises when
the person reaches a point which feels to be the lowest, as
all the points surrounding it is higher in slope, but in
reality it is not so. Such a point, which is local minima and
not global minima, may be deceiving and stalls the
algorithm before reaching the real global minima.

We have already seen that multi-layer neural networks have

multiple hidden layers. During the learning phase, the
interconnection weights are adjusted on the basis of the errors
generated by the network, i.e. difference in the output signal of
the network vis-�-vis the expected value. These errors
generated at the output layer are propagated back to the
preceding layers. Because of the backward propagation of
errors which happens during the learning phase, these
networks are also called back-propagation networks or simply
backpropagation nets. One such backpropagation net with one
hidden layer is depicted in Figure 10.22. In this network, X  is
the bias input to the hidden layer and Y  is the bias input to the
output layer.

0

0

The net signal input to the hidden layer neurons is given by

for the k-th neuron in the hidden layer. If f  is the activation

y

function of the hidden layer, then

FIG. 10.22 Backpropagation net

The net signal input to the output layer neurons is given by

for the k-th neuron in the output layer. Note that the input
signals to X  and Y  are assumed as 1. If f  is the activation
function of the hidden layer, then

0

0

z

k

If t  is the target output of the k-th output neuron, then the
cost function defined as the squared error of the output layer is
given by

Note:

There are two types of gradient descent algorithms. When
a full data set is used in one shot to compute the gradient,
it is known as full batch gradient descent. In the case of
stochastic gradient descent, which is also known as
incremental gradient descent, smaller samples of the data
are taken iteratively and used in the gradient computation.
Thus, stochastic gradient descent tries to identify the
global minima.

So, as a part of the gradient descent algorithm, partial

derivative of the cost function E has to be done with respect to
each of the interconnection weights w? w?
02, � ,
Mathematically, it can be represented as follows:

w?

01,

nr.

for the interconnection weight between the j-th neuron in
the hidden layer and the k-th neuron in the output layer. This
expression can be deduced to

If we assume

as a component of

the weight adjustment needed for weight w  corresponding to
the k-th output neuron, then

jk

On the basis of this, the weights and bias need to be updated

as follows:

Note that �?� is the learning rate of the neural network.

In the same way, we can perform the calculations for the
interconnection weights between the input and hidden layers.
The weights and bias for the interconnection between the input
and hidden layers need to be updated as follows:

Note:

Learning rate is a user parameter which increases or
decreases the speed with which the interconnection
weights of a neural network is to be adjusted. If the
learning rate is too high, the adjustment done as a part of
the gradient descent process may miss the minima. Then,
the training may not converge, and it may even diverge.
On the other hand, if the learning rate is too low, the
optimization may consume more time because of the small
steps towards the minima.

A balanced approach is to start the training with a
relatively large learning rate (say 0.1), because in the
beginning, random weights are far from optimal. Then, the
learning rate should be decreased during training (say
exponentially lower values, e.g. 0.01, 0.001, etc.) to allow
more fine-grained weight updates.

10.9 DEEP LEARNING

Neural networks, as we have already seen in this chapter, are a
class of machine learning algorithms. As we have also seen,
there are multiple choices of architectures for neural networks,

multi-layer neural network being one of the most adopted
ones. However, in a multi-layer neural network, as we keep
increasing the number of hidden layers, the computation
becomes very expensive. Going beyond two to  three layers
becomes quite difficult computationally. The only way to
handle such intense computation is by using graphics
processing unit (GPU) computing.

When we have less number of hidden layers � at the

maximum two to three layers, it is a normal neural network,
which is sometimes given the fancy name �shallow neural
network�. However, when the number of layers increases, it is
termed as deep neural network. One of the earliest deep neural
networks had three hidden layers. Deep learning is a more
contemporary branding of deep neural networks, i.e.
multilayer neural networks having more than three layers.
More detailed understanding of deep learning is beyond the
scope of this book.

10.10 SUMMARY

Artificial neural network (ANN) is inspired by the biological neural network.
In an ANN, the biological form of neuron is replicated in the electronic or
digital form of neuron.
Each neuron has three major components:
A set of synapses having weight
A summation junction for the input signals weighted by the respective
synaptic weight
A threshold activation function results in an output signal only when
an input signal exceeding a specific threshold value comes as an input

Different types of activation functions include:

Threshold/Step function
Identity function
ReLU function
Sigmoid function
Hyperbolic tangent function

ADALINE Network Model

Some of the architectures of neural network include

Single-layer feed forward ANNs: simplest and most basic architecture
consisting on an input and output layer.
Multi-layer feed forward ANNs � there are one or more hidden
intermediate layers of neurons between the input and the output layers
Competitive network � similar to single-layer feed forward network.
The only difference is that the output neurons are connected with each
other (either partially or fully).
Recurrent networks � single or multi-layer, with a feedback loop from
the neurons in the output layer to the input layer neurons. There may
also be self-loops.

There are four major aspects which need to be decided while learning using
ANN

The number of layers in the network
The direction of signal flow
The number of nodes in each layer
The value of weights attached with each interconnection between
neurons

In the backpropagation algorithm, errors are propagated back from the output
layer to the preceding layers. The backpropagation algorithm is applicable
for multi-layer feed forward network.
A technique termed as gradient descent is used to adjust the interconnection
weights between neurons of different layers.
When the number of hidden layers in multi-layer neural networks is higher
than three, it is termed as deep neural network. Deep learning is a more
contemporary branding of deep neural networks.

Other Types of Learning

OBJECTIVE OF THE CHAPTER :

In the previous chapters, you have got good understanding
of supervised learning algorithm and unsupervised
learning algorithm. In this chapter, we will discuss learning
types which were not covered in the earlier chapters which
includes representation learning, active learning, instance-
based Learning, association rule, and ensemble learning.
By the end of this chapter, you will gain sufficient
knowledge in all the aspects of learning and become ready
to start solving problems on your own.

11.1 INTRODUCTION

In this chapter, we will discuss learning types which were not
covered in the earlier chapters which include representation
learning, active learning, instance-based Learning, association
rule, and ensemble learning.

11.2 REPRESENTATION LEARNING

Another name for representation learning is feature learning.
While many enterprises nowadays retain substantial amounts
of business-related data, most of those are often unstructured
and unlabelled. Creating new labels is generally a time-
consuming and expensive endeavour. As a result, machine
learning algorithms that can straight away mine structures
from unlabelled data to improve the business performance are
reasonably valued. Representation learning is one such type
where the extraction from the overall unlabelled data happens
using a �neural network�. The main objective of representation
learning (feature learning) is to find an appropriate
representation of data based on features to perform a machine
learning task. Representation learning has become a field in
itself because of its popularity. Refer the chapter 4 titled
�Basics of Feature Engineering� to understand more on feature
and feature selection process. An example of some of the
characteristics of a triangle are its corners (or vertices), sides,
and degree of angle. Every triangle has three corners and three
angles. Sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to 180�.
The types of triangles with their characteristics are given
below.

Consider you are tasked to classify/identify the types of
triangles (Refer Table 11.1). The way you do that is to find
unique characteristics of the type of triangle given as input.

The system may work something like this

Input � Triangular image

Representation � Three angles, length of sides.

Model � It gets an input representation (angles, length of sides) and applies
rules as per Table 11.1 to detect the type of triangle.

Great! Now, we have a primary representational working

system to detect the type of triangle.

What happens when we begin to input shapes like square,

rectangle, circle, or all sort of shapes instead of a triangle?
What if the image contains both a triangle and a circle?
Designing to adapt to this kind of features requires deep
domain expertise as we start working with real-world
applications. Deep Learning goes one step further and
learns/tries to learn features on its own. All we would do is to
feed in an image as input and let the system learn features like
human beings do.

Representation learnings are most widely used in words,

speech recognition, signal processing, music, and image
identification. For example, a word can have meaning based
on the context.

Table 11.1 Types of Triangle

FIG. 11.1 Generation versus recognition

In Figure 11.1, V represents the input data, and H represents

the causes. When the causes (H) explains the data (V) we
observe, it is called as Recognition. When unknown causes
(H) are combined, it can also generate the data (V), it is called
as generative (or) Generation.

Representation learning is inspired by the fact that machine

learning tasks such as classification regularly requires
numerical inputs that are mathematically and computationally
easy to process. However, it is difficult to define the features
algorithmically for real-world objects such as images and
videos. An alternative is to discover such features or

representations just through examination, without trusting on
explicit algorithms. So, representation learning can be either
supervised or unsupervised.

1. Supervised neural networks and multilayer perceptron
2. Independent component analysis (unsupervised)
3. Autoencoders (unsupervised) and
4. Various forms of clustering.

11.2.1 Supervised neural networks and multilayer
perceptron

Refer the chapter 10 titled �Basics of Neural Network� to
understand more on the topic of the neural network.

11.2.2 Independent component analysis (Unsupervised)

Independent component analysis, or ICA is similar to principal
component analysis (PCA), with the exception that the
components are independent and uncorrelated. ICA is used
primarily for separating unknown source signals from their
observed linear mixtures after the linear mixture with an
unfamiliar matrix (A) . Nil information is known about the
sources or the mixing process except that there are N different
recorded mixtures. The job is to recuperate a version(U) of the
sources (S) which are identical except for scaling and
permutation, by finding a square matrix (W) specifying spatial
filters that linearly invert the mixing process, i.e. U = WX.
Maximizing the joint entropy, H(y), of the output of a neural
processor minimizes the mutual information among the output
components (Refer Fig. 11.2).

FIG. 11.2 Independent component analysis

11.2.3 Autoencoders

Autoencoders belong to the neural network family (Refer Fig.
11.3) and are similar to Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
They are more flexible than PCA. Autoencoders represents
both linear and non-linear transformation, whereas PCA
represents only linear transformation. The neural network�s
(autoencoder) target output is its input (x) in a different form
(x�). In Autoencoders, the dimensionality of the input is equal
to the dimensionality of the output, and essentially what we
want is x� = x. x� = Decode (Encode(x))

To get the value from the hidden layer, we multiply the
(input to hidden) weights by the input. To get the value from
the output, we multiply (hidden to output) weights by the
hidden layer values.

about various forms of Clustering.

11.3 ACTIVE LEARNING

Active learning is a type of semi-supervised learning in which
a learning algorithm can interactively query (question) the user
to obtain the desired outputs at new data points.

Let P be the population set of all data under consideration.
For example, all male students studying in a college are known
to have a particularly exciting study pattern.

During each iteration, I, P (total population) is broken up

into three subsets.

1. P(K, i): Data points where the label is known (K).
2. P(U, i): Data points where the label is unknown (U)
3. P(C, i): A subset of P(U, i)that is chosen (C) to be labelled.

Current research in this type of active learning concentrates

on identifying the best method P(C, i) to chose (C) the data
points.

11.3.1 Heuristics for active learning

1. Start with a pool of unlabelled data P(U, i)
2. Pick a few points at random and get their labels P(C, i)
3. Repeat

Some active learning algorithms are built upon aupport vector
machines (SVMs) to determine the data points to label. Such
methods usually calculate the margin (W) of each unlabelled
datum in P(U, i) and assume W as an n-dimensional space
distance commencing covering datum and the splitting
hyperplane.

Minimum marginal hyperplane (MMH) techniques consent
that the data records with the minimum margin (W) are those
that the SVM is most uncertain about and therefore should be
retained in P(C, i) to be labelled. Other comparable
approaches, such as Maximum Marginal Hyperplane, select
data with the significant W (n-dimensional space). Other
approaches to select a combination of the smallest as well as
largest Ws.

11.3.2 Active learning query strategies

Few logics for determining which data points should be
labelled are

1. Uncertainty sampling
2. Query by committee
3. Expected model change
4. Expected error reduction
5. Variance reduction

Uncertainty sampling: In this method, the active learning
algorithm first tries to label the points for which the current

model is least specific (as this means a lot of confusion) on the
correct output.

Query by committee: A range of models are trained on the

current labelled data, and vote on the output for unlabelled
data; label those points for which the �committee� disagrees
the most.

Expected model change: In this method, the active learning
algorithm first tries to label the points that would most change
the existing model itself.

Expected error reduction: In this method, the active learning

algorithm first tries to label the points that would mostly
reduce the model�s generalization error.

Variance reduction: In this method, the active learning
algorithm first tries to label the points that would reduce
output variance (which is also one of the components of error).

11.4 INSTANCE-BASED LEARNING (MEMORY-BASED LEARNING)

In instance-based learning (memory-based learning), the
algorithm compares new problem instances with instances
already seen in training, which have been stored in memory
for reference rather than performing explicit generalization. It
is called instance-based as it constructs hypotheses from the
training instances (memories) themselves. Computational
complexity O(n) of the hypothesis can grow when we have
some data (n). It can quickly adapt its model to previously
unseen data. New instances are either stored or thrown away
based on the previously set criteria.

Examples of instance-based learning include K-nearest
neighbour algorithm (K-NN), kernel machines (support vector

machine, PCA), and radial basis function (RBF) networks.

All these algorithms store already known instances and

compute distances or similarities between this instance and the
training instances to make the final decision. Instance
reduction algorithm can be used to overcome memory
complexity problem and overfitting problems. Let us look into
radial basis function (RBF) in detail.

11.4.1 Radial basis function

Radial basis function (RBF) networks typically have three
layers: one input layer, one hidden layer with a non-linear RBF
activation function, and one linear output layer (Refer Fig.
11.4).

FIG. 11.4 Radial Basis Function

In the above diagram, an input vector(x) is used as input to
all radial basis functions, each with different parameters. The
input layer (X) is merely a fan-out layer, and no processing
happens here. The second layer (hidden) performs radial basis
functions, which are the non-linear mapping from the input
space (Vector X) into a higher order dimensional space. The
output of the network (Y) is a linear combination of the

outputs from radial basis functions. If pattern classification is
required (in Y), then a hard-limiter or sigmoid function could
be placed on the output neurons to give 0/1 output values.

The distinctive part of the radial basis function network
(RFFN) is the procedure implemented in the hidden layer. The
idea is that the patterns in the input space form clusters.
Beyond this area (clustering area, RFB function area), the
value drops dramatically. The Gaussian function is the most
commonly used radial-basis function. In an RBF network, r is
the distance from the cluster centre.

Space (distance) computed from the cluster centre is usually

the Euclidean distance. For each neuron that is part of the
hidden layer, the weights represent the coordinates of the
centre of the cluster. Therefore, when that neuron receives an
input pattern, X, the distance is found using the following
equation:

The variable sigma, ?, denotes the width or radius of the
bell-shape and is to be determined by calculation. When the
distance from the centre of the Gaussian reaches ?, the output
drops from 1 to 0.6.

The output y(t) is a weighted sum of the outputs of the

hidden layer, given by

where

u(t) is the input

?(.) is an arbitrary non-linear radial basis function

?.? denotes the norm that is usually assumed to be

Euclidean

c  are the known centres of the radial basis functions
i

w  are the weights of the function

i

In radial functions, the response decreases (or increases)
monotonically with distance from a central point and they are
radially symmetric. The centre, the distance scale, and the
exact shape of the radial function are the necessary
considerations of the defined model. The most commonly used
radial function is the Gaussian radial filter, which in case of a
scalar input is

Its parameters are its centre c and its radius ? (width),

illustrates a Gaussian RBF with centre c = 0 and radius ? = 1.
A Gaussian RBF monotonically decreases with distance from
the centre.

11.4.2 Pros and cons of instance-based learning method

Advantage: Instance-based learning (IBL) methods are particularly well
suited to problems where the target function is highly complex, but can also be
defined by a group of not as much of complex local approximations.

The disadvantage I: The cost of classification of new instances can be high (a
majority of the calculation takes place at this stage).

Disadvantage II: Many IBL approaches usually study all characteristics of the
instances leading to dimensionality-related problems.

11.5 ASSOCIATION RULE LEARNING ALGORITHM

Association rule learning is a method that extracts rules that
best explain observed relationships between variables in data.
These rules can discover important and commercially useful
associations in large multidimensional data sets that can be
exploited by an organization. The most popular association
rule learning algorithms are Apriori algorithm and Eclat
process.

11.5.1 Apriori algorithm

Apriori is designed to function on a large database containing
various types of transactions (for example, collections of
products bought by customers, or details of websites visited by
customers frequently). Apriori algorithm uses a �bottom-up�
method, where repeated subsets are extended one item at a
time (a step is known as candidate generation, and groups of
candidates are tested against the data). The Apriori Algorithm
is a powerful algorithm for frequent mining of itemsets for
boolean association rules. Refer chapter 9 titled �unsupervised
learning� to understand more on this algorithm.

11.5.2 Eclat algorithm

ECLAT stands for �Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-
up Lattice Traversal�. Eclat algorithm is another set of
frequent itemset generation similar to Apriori algorithm. Three

traversal approaches such as �Top-down�, �Bottom-up�, and
Hybrid approaches are supported. Transaction IDs (TID list)
are stored here. It represents the data in vertical format.

Step 1: Get Transaciton IDs : tidlist for each item (DB scan).

Step 2. Transaciton IDs (tidlist) of {a} is exactly the list of transactions
covering {a}.

Step 3. Intersect tidlist of {a} with the tidlists of all other items, resulting in
tidlists of {a,b}, {a,c}, {a,d}, � = {a}�conditional database (if {a} removed).

Step 4. Repeat from 1 on {a}�conditional database 5. Repeat for all other
items.

11.6 ENSEMBLE LEARNING ALGORITHM

Ensemble means collaboration/joint/group. Ensemble methods
are models that contain many weaker models that are
autonomously trained and whose forecasts are combined
approximately to create the overall prediction model. More
efforts are required to study the types of weak learners and
various ways to combine them.

The most popular ensemble learning algorithms are

Bootstrap Aggregation (bagging)

Boosting

AdaBoost

Stacked Generalization (blending)

Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT)

Random Forest

11.6.1 Bootstrap aggregation (Bagging)

Bootstrap Aggregation (bagging) works using the principle of
the Bootstrap sampling method. Given a training data set D

containing m examples, bootstrap drawing method draws a
sample of training examples D , by selecting m examples in
i
uniform random with replacement. It comprises two phases
namely Training phase and Classification Phase.

Training Phase:

1. Initialize the parameters
2. D = {? }
3. H = the number of classification
4. For k = 1 to h
5. Take a bootstrap sample S  from training set S
6. Build the classifier D  using S  as a training set
k
7. D = D?D
i
8. Return D

k

k

Classification Phase:

1. Run D , D ,���..D  on the input k
2. The class with a maximum number of the vote is chosen as the label for

1

2

k

X.

In the above example, the original sample has eight data
points. All the Bootstrap samples also have eight data points.

Within the same bootstrap sample, data points are repeated due
to selection with the replacement.

11.6.2 Boosting

Just like bagging, boosting is another key ensemble-based
technique. Boosting is an iterative technique. It decreases the
biasing error. If an observation was classified incorrectly, then
it boosts the weight of that observation. In this type of
ensemble, weaker learning models are trained on resampled
data, and the outcomes are combined using a weighted voting
approach based on the performance of different models.
Adaptive boosting or AdaBoost is a special variant of a
boosting algorithm. It is based on the idea of generating weak
learners and learning slowly.

11.6.3 Gradient boosting machines (GBM)

As we know already, boosting is the machine learning
algorithm, which boosts week learner to strong learner. We
may already know that a learner estimates a target function
from training data. Gradient boosting is the boosting with
Gradient.

Gradient: Consider L as a function of an ith variable, other

N ? 1 variables are fixed at the current point, by calculating
derivative of L at that point (L is differentiable), we have � if
the derivative is positive/negative � a decrease/increase value
of the ith variable in order to make the loss smaller (*).
Applying the above calculation for all i = 1� N, we will get N
derivative values forming a vector, so-called gradient of an N-
variable function at the current point.

11.7 REGULARIZATION ALGORITHM

This is an extension made to another method (typically
regression method) that penalizes models based on their
complexity, favouring simpler models that are also better at
generalizing. Regularization algorithms have been listed
separately here because they are famous, influential, and
generally simple modifications made to other methods.

The most popular regularization algorithms are

Ridge Regression

Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)

Elastic Net

Least-Angle Regression (LARS)

Refer chapter 8 titled �Supervised Learning: Regression�

for Ridge regression and the LASSO method.

Elastic Net

When we are working with high-dimensional data sets with

a large number of independent variables, correlations
(relationships) amid the variables can be often result in
multicollinearity. These correlated variables which are strictly
related can sometimes form groups or clusters called as an
elastic net of correlated variables. We would want to include
the complete group in the model selection even if just one
variable has been selected.

11.8 SUMMARY

Another name for Representation learning is feature learning.
Representation learnings are most widely used in words, speech recognition,
signal processing, music, and images identification. For example, a word can
have meaning based on the context.
Independent component analysis, or ICA) is similar to principal components
analysis (PCA), with the exception that the components are independent and
uncorrelated.

Autoencoders belongs to neural network family and are similar to PCA
(Principal Component Analysis). They are more flexible than PCA.
Active learning is a type of semi-supervised learning in which a learning
algorithm can interactively query (question) the user to obtain the desired
outputs at new data points.
Uncertainty sampling: In this method, the active learning algorithm first tries
to label the points for which the current model is least specific (a that means
much confusion) on the correct output.
In instance-based learning (memory-based learning), the algorithm compares
new problem instances with instances already seen in training, which have
been stored in memory for reference rather than performing explicit
generalization.
Examples of instance-based learning include K-nearest neighbor algorithm
(K-NN), Kernel machines (Support Vector Machine, PCA) and Radial Basis
Function networks (RBF networks).
Radial basis function (RBF) networks typically have three layers: one input
layer, one hidden layer with a non-linear RBF activation function and one
linear output layer.
Association rule learning is methods that extract rules that best explain
observed relationships between variables in data. These rules can discover
important and commercially useful associations in large multidimensional
datasets that can be exploited by an organization.

Programming Machine Learning in R

A.1 PRE-REQUISITES

Before starting with machine learning programming in R, we
need to fulfil certain pre-requisites. Quite understandably, the
first and foremost activity is to install R and get started with
the basic programming interface of R, i.e. R console. Then, we
need to become familiar with the R commands and scripting in
R. In this section, we will have a step-by-step guide of
fulfilling these pre-requisites.

A.1.1 Install R in Your System

R 3.5.0 or higher (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
RStudio 1.1.453 or higher (Optional, only if you want to leverage the
advantage of using an integrated development environment (IDE).
Otherwise, R console is sufficient.)
(https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

A.1.1.1 Note

The Comprehensive R Archive Network (or CRAN) is a worldwide network
of ftp and web servers that store identical and up-to-date versions of code
and documentation for R.
RStudio is a free and open-source IDE for R.

A.1.3.2 Basic data types in R

Vector: This data structure contains similar types of data, i.e. integer, double,
logical, complex, etc. The function c () is used to create vectors.

> num <- c(1,3.4,-2,-10.85) #numeric vector
> char <- c(�a�,�hello�,�280�) #character vector
>  bool  <-  c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE)  #logical
vector
> print(num)
[1] 1.0 3.4 -2.0 -10.85

Matrix: Matrix is a 2-D data structure and can be created using the matrix ()
function. The values for rows and columns can be defined using �nrow� and
�ncol� arguments. However, providing both is not required as the other
dimension is automatically acquired with the help of the length parameter
(first index : last index).

List: This data structure is slightly different from vectors in the sense that it
contains a mixture of different data types A list is created using the list ()

function.

Factor: The factor stores the nominal values as a vector of integers in the
range [1�k] (where k is the number of unique values in the nominal
variable) and an internal vector of character strings (the original values)
mapped to these items.

> data <- c(�A�,�B�,�B�,�C�,�A�,�B�,�C�,�C�,�B�)

component is of the same length. Data frame is created using the frame ()
function.

> cbind(data[,3], data[,5]) # Bind sets of
columns, with the same number of rows

> data <- data[!data$model.year > 74,]
#Remove all rows with model year greater
than 74

Note:

For advanced data manipulation, the dplyr library of R
(developed by Hadley Wickham et al) can be leveraged. It
is the next version of the plyr package focused on working
with data frames (hence the name �d�plyr).

In R, the pipe (%>%) operator allows to pipe the output
from one function to the input of another function. Instead of
nesting functions (reading from inside to outside), the idea of
piping is to read the functions from left to right.

A.2 PREPARING TO MODEL

Now that we are reasonably familiar with the basic R
commands, we have acquired the ability to start machine
learning programming in R. But before starting the actual
modelling work, we have to first understand the data using the
concepts highlighted in Chapter 2. Also, there might be some
issues in the data, which we will reveal during data
exploration. We have to remediate that too.

So first, let us find out how to do data exploration in R.

There are two ways to explore and understand data:

1. By using certain statistical functions to understand the central tendency

and spread of the data

2. By visually observing the data in the form of plots or graphs

A.2.1 Basic Statistical Functions for Data Exploration

Let us start with the first approach of understanding the data
through statistical techniques. As we have seen in Chapter 2,
for any data set, it is critical to understand the central tendency
and spread of the data. We have also seen that the standard
statistical measures used are as follows:

1. Measures of central tendency � mean, median, mode
2. Measures of data spread

1. Dispersion of data � variance, standard deviation
2. Position of the different data values � quartiles, interquartile

range (IQR)

In R, there is a function summary, which generates the
summary statistics of the attributes of a data set. It gives the
first basic understanding of the data set, which can trigger
thoughts about the data set and the anomalies that may be
present. We will use another diagnostic function, str, which
compactly provides the structure of a data frame along with

the data types of the different attributes. So, let us start
exploring a data set Auto MPG data set from the University
of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. We
will run the str and summary commands for the Auto MPG
data set.

Looking closely at the output of the summary command,
there are six measures listed for the attributes (well, most of
them). These are

1. Min. � minimum value of the attribute
2. 1st Qu. � first quartile (for details, refer to Chapter 2)
3. Median
4. Mean
5. 3rd Qu. � third quartile (for details, refer to Chapter 2)
6. Max. � maximum value of the attribute

These measures give quite good understanding of the data

set attributes. Now, note that the attribute car.name is not
showing these values and showing something else. Why is that
so and what are the values that it is showing? Let us try to
understand the reason for this difference.

The attribute car.name is a nominal, i.e. categorical

attribute. As we have already seen in Chapter 2, mathematical
or statistical operations are not possible for a nominal variable.
Hence, only the unique values for the attribute along with the
number of occurrences or frequency are given. We can obtain
an exhaustive list of nominal attributes using the following R
command.

Next, let us try to explore whether any variable has any
issue with the data values where a cleaning may be required.
As discussed in Chapter 2, there may be two primary data
issues: missing values and outliers.

Let us first try to determine whether there is any missing
value for any of the attributes. Let us use a small piece of R
code to find out whether there is any missing/ unwanted value
for an attribute in the data. If there is such issue, return the
rows in which the attribute has missing/unwanted values. By
checking all the attributes, we find that the attribute
�horsepower� has missing values.

There are six rows in the data set, which have missing

values for the attribute �horsepower�. We will have to
remediate these rows before we proceed with the modelling
activities. We will do that shortly.

The easiest and most effective method to detect outliers is
from the box plot of the attributes. In the box plot, outliers are
very clearly highlighted. When we explore the attributes using
box plots in a short while, we will have a clear view of this
aspect.

Let us quickly see the other R commands for obtaining

statistical measures of the numeric attributes.

> range(data$mpg) #Gives minimum and
maximum values

[1] 9.0 46.6

> diff(range(data$mpg))

[1] 37.6

> quantile(data$mpg)

0% 25% 50% 75% 100%

9.0 17.5 23.0 29.0 46.6

> IQR(data$mpg)

[1] 11.5

> mean(data$mpg)

[1] 23.51457

> median(data$mpg)

[1] 23

> var(data$mpg)

[1] 61.08961

> sd(data$mpg)

[1] 7.815984

Note:

To perform data exploration (as well as data visualization),
the ggplot2 library of R can be leveraged. Created by
Hadley Wickham, the ggplot2 library offers a
comprehensive graphics module for creating elaborate and
complex plots.

A.2.2 Basic Plots for Data Exploration

To start using the library functions of ggplot2, we need to load
the library as follows:

> library(ggplot2)

Let us now understand the different graphs that are used for

data exploration and how to generate them using R code.

A.2.2.1 Box plot

Syntax: boxplot (x, data, notch, varwidth, names, main)

Usage:

> boxplot(iris) # Iris is a popular data
set used in machine learning, which comes
bundled in R installation

A separate window opens in R console with the box plot

generated as shown in Figure A.3.

As we can see, Figure A.3 shows the box plot of the entire
iris data set, i.e. for all the features in the iris data set, there is a
component or box plot in the overall plot. However, if we want

to review individual features separately, we can do that too
using the following R command.

> boxplot(iris$Sepal.Width,
main=�Boxplot�, ylab = �Sepal.Width�)

The output of the command, i.e. the box plot of an

individual feature, sepal width, of the iris data set is shown in
Figure A.4.

FIG. A.3 Box plot of an entire data set

FIG. A.4 Box plot of a specific feature

A.2.2.2 Histogram

Syntax: hist (v, main, xlab, xlim, ylim, breaks, col, border)

Usage:

> hist(iris$Sepal.Length, main =
�Histogram�, xlab = �Sepal Length�, col =
�blue�, border = �green�)

The output of the command, i.e. the histogram of an

individual feature, petal length, of the iris data set is shown in
Figure A.5.

FIG. A.5 Histogram of a specific feature

A.2.2.3 Scatterplot

Syntax: plot (x, y, main, xlab, ylab, xlim, ylim, axes)

Usage:

>
plot(Sepal.Length~Petal.Length,data=iris,m
ain=�Scatter Plot�,xlab=�Petal
Length�,ylab=�Sepal Length�)

> abline(lm(iris $Sepal.Length~
iris$Petal.Length), col=�red�) # Fit a
regression line (red) to show the trend

The output of the command, i.e. the scatter plot of the

feature pair petal length and sepal length of the iris data set, is
shown in Figure A.6.

FIG. A.6 Scatter plot of petal length vs sepal length

A.2.3 Data Pre-Processing

The primary data pre-processing activities are remediating
data issues related to outliers and missing values. Also, feature
subset selection is quite a critical area of data pre-processing.
Let us understand how to write programmes for achieving
these purposes.

A.2.3.1 Handling outliers and missing values

As we saw in Chapter 2, the primary measures for remediating
outliers and missing values are as follows:

Removing specific rows containing outliers/missing values
Imputing the value (i.e. outlier/missing value) with a standard statistical
measure, e.g. mean or median or mode for that attribute
Estimate the value (i.e. outlier/missing value) on the basis of value of the
attribute in similar records and replace with the estimated value.
Cap the values within 1.5 times IQR limits

Removing outliers/missing values

We have to first identify the outliers. We have already seen in
boxplots that outliers are clearly visible when we draw the box
plot of a specific attribute. Hence, we can use the same
concept as shown in the following code:

> outliers <-

boxplot.stats(data$mpg)$out

Then, those rows can be removed using the code:

> data <- data[!(data$mpg == outliers),]

OR,

> data <- data[-which(data$mpg ==

outliers),]

For missing value identification and removal, the below

code is used:

> data1 <- data[!

(is.na(data$horsepower)),]

Imputing standard values

The code for identification of outliers or missing values will
remain the same. For imputation, depending on which
statistical function is to be used for imputation, the code will
be as follows:

> library(dplyr)

# Only the affected rows are identified
and the value of the attribute is
transformed to the mean value of the
attribute

> imputedrows <- data[which(data$mpg ==
outliers),] %>% mutate(mpg =
mean(data$mpg))

# Affected rows are removed from the data
set

> outlier_removed_rows <- data[-
which(data$mpg == outliers),]

# Recombine the imputed row and the
remaining part of the data set

> data <- rbind(outlier_removed_rows,
imputedrows)

Almost the same code can be used for imputing missing
values with the only difference being in the identification of
the relevant rows.

> imputedrows <-
data[(is.na(data$horsepower)),]%>% mutate
(horsepower = mean(data$horsepower))

> missval_removed_rows <- data[!
(is.na(data$horsepower)),]

> data <- rbind(outlier_removed_rows,
imputedrows)

Capping of values

The code for identification of outlier values will remain the
same. For capping, generally a value of 1.5 times the IQR is
used for imputation, and the code will be as follows:

> library(dplyr)

> outliers <- boxplot.stats(data$mpg)$out

> imputedrows <- data[which(data$mpg ==
outliers),] %>% mutate(mpg =
1.5*IQR(data$mpg))

> outlier_removed_rows <- data[-
which(data$mpg == outliers),]

> data <- rbind(outlier_removed_rows,
imputedrows)

A.3 MODELLING AND EVALUATION

Note:

The caret package (short for Classification And
REgression Training) contains functions to streamline the
model training process for complex regression and
classification problems. The package contains tools for

data splitting
different pre-processing functionalities
feature selection
model tuning using resampling
model performance evaluation

as well as other functionalities.

A.4 MODEL TRAINING

To start using the functions of the caret package, we need to
include the caret as follows:

> library(caret)

A.4.1 Holdout

The first step before the start of modelling, in the case of
supervised learning, is to load the input data, holdout a portion
of the input data as test data, and use the remaining portion as
training data for building the model. Below is the standard
procedure to do it.

> inputdata <- read.csv(�btissue.csv�)

> split = 0.7 #Ratio in which the input
data is to be split to training and test
data. A split value = 0.7 indicates 70% of
the data will be training data, i.e. 30%
of the input data is retained as test data

> set.seed(123) # This step is optional,
needed for result reproducibility

> trainIndex <- createDataPartition (y =
inputdata$class, p = split, list = FALSE)
# Does a stratified random split

of data into training and test sets

> train_ds <- inputdata [trainIndex,]

> test_ds <- inputdata [-trainIndex,]

A.4.2 K-Fold Cross-Validation

Let us do a 10-fold cross-validation. For creating the cross-
validation, functions from the caret package can be used as
follows:

Next, we perform the data holdout.

train_ds <- inputdata [-

ten_folds$Fold01,]

test_ds <- inputdata [ten_folds$Fold01,]

Note:

When we perform data holdout, i.e. splitting of the input
data into training and test data sets, the records selected for
each set are picked randomly. So, it is obvious that

executing the same code or R function may result in
different training data sets. The model trained will also be
somewhat different.

In R, there is a set.seed function which sets the starting
point of the random number generator used internally to
pick the records. This ensures that random numbers of a
specific sequence are used every time, and hence, the same
records (i.e. records having the same sequence number) are
picked every time and the model is trained in the same
way. This is extremely critical for the reproducibility of
results, i.e. every time, the same machine learning program
generates the same set of results. The code is as follows:

> set.seed (5)

A.4.3 Bootstrap Sampling

To generate a bootstrap sample for any statistics, R package
boot can be used. A sample code is given below.

> install.packages (�boot�)

> library (boot)

myfunc <- function (){

# body of the function �
return (someval)
}

> bootcorr <- boot(data = mydata,
statistic = myfunc, R = 500) # R is the

number of bootstrap samples

A.4.4 Training the Model

Once the model preparatory steps such as data holdout, etc. are
completed, the actual training starts using the following code
or similar codes.

> model <- train(class ~ ., method =
�rpart�, data = train_ds) # Code for the
decision tree model

A.4.5 Evaluating Model Performance

There are different ways to evaluate the different models in
supervised and unsupervised learning. Some of them, as we
have seen, have been discussed in Chapter 3. Now, it is time to
see how we can implement them through R code.

A.4.5.1 Supervised learning - classification

In supervised learning, model accuracy is the most critical
measure for evaluating a model�s performance. There are also
other measures such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall,
etc., each of which we have studied in Chapter 3. R library
caret gives a function confusionMatrix to reveal the confusion
matrix of a model, and on the basis of the confusion matrix,
values of the different measures, namely accuracy, sensitivity,
specificity, precision, recall, etc., are obtained. Figure A.7
presents a snapshot of the confusionMatrix output for a
specific data set.

FIG. A.7 Performance evaluation of a classification model (Decision Tree)

> predictions <- predict(model, test_ds,
na.action = na.pass)

> cm <- confusionMatrix(predictions,
test_ds$class)

> print(cm)

> print(cm$overall[�Accuracy�])

A.4.5.2 Supervised learning - regression

The summary function, when applied to a regression model,
displays the different performance measures such as residual

standard error, multiple R-squared, etc., both for simple and
multiple linear regression.

A.4.5.3 Unsupervised learning - clustering

As we have seen in Chapter 3, there are two popular measures
of cluster quality: purity and silhouette width. Purity can be
calculated only when class label is known for the data set
subjected to clustering. On the other hand, silhouette width can
be calculated for any data set.

Purity

We will use a Lower Back Pain Symptoms data set released by
Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sammy123/lower-back-pain-
symptoms-dataset). The data set spine.csv consists of 310
observations and 13 attributes (12 numeric predictors, 1 binary
class attribute).

> library(fpc)

> data <- read.csv(�spine.csv�) #Loading
the Kaggle data set

> data_wo_class <- data[,-length(data)]
#Stripping off the class attribute from
the data set before clustering

> class <- data[,length(data)] #Storing
the class attribute in a separate variable
for later use

> dis = dist(data_wo_class)^2

> res = kmeans(data_wo_class,2) #Can use
other clustering algorithms too

#Let us define a custom function to
compare cluster value with the original
class value and calculate the percentage
match

ClusterPurity <- function(clusters,
classes) {

sum(apply(table(classes, clusters), 2,
max)) / length(clusters)

}

> ClusterPurity(res$cluster, class)

Output

[1] 0.6774194

Silhouette width

Use the R library cluster to find out/plot the silhouette width
of the clusters formed. The piece of code below clusters the
records in the data set spinem.csv (the same data set as
spine.csv with the target variable removed) using the k-means
algorithm and then calculates the silhouette width of the
clusters formed.

> library (cluster)

> data <- read.csv(�spinem.csv�)

> dis = dist(data)^2

> res = kmeans(data,2) #Can use other
clustering algorithms too

> sil_width <- silhouette (res$cluster,
dis)

> sil_summ <- summary(sil_width)

> sil_summ$clus.avg.widths # Returns
silhouette width of each cluster

> sil_summ$avg.width # Returns silhouette
width of the overall data set

Output

Silhouette width of each cluster:

1          2

0.7473583 0.1921082

Silhouette width of the overall data set:

[1] 0.5413785

A.5 FEATURE ENGINEERING

A.5.1 Feature Construction

For performing feature construction, we can use mutate
function of the dplyr package. Following is a small code for

feature construction using the iris data set.

A.5.1.1 Dummy coding categorical (nominal) variables

As in the above case, we can use the dummy.code function of
the psych package to encode categorical variables. Following
is a small code for the same.

> library(psych)

> age <- c(18,20,23,19,18,22)

> city <- c(�City A�,�City B�,�City
A�,�City C�,�City B�)

> data <- data.frame(age, city)

> data

A.5.1.2 Encoding categorical (ordinal) variables

A.5.1.3 Transforming numeric (continuous) features to
categorical features

A.5.2 Feature Extraction

A.5.2.1 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

For performing principal component analysis (PCA), we can
use the prcomp function of the stats package. Following is the
code using the iris data set. PCA should be applied to the
predictors. The class variable can be used to visualize the
principal components.

The output of the biplot function is given in Figure A.8

FIG. A.8 Principal components of the iris data set

A.5.2.2 Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

For performing singular value decomposition, we can use the
svd function of the stats package. Following is the code using
the iris data set.

> sing_val_decomp <- svd(iris[,1:4])

> print(sing_val_decomp$d)

Output:

[1] 95.959914 17.761034 3.460931 1.884826

A.5.2.3 Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

For performing linear discriminant analysis, we can use the
lda function of the MASS package. Following is the code
using the UCI data set btissue.

The output of the above function is given in Figure A.9

FIG. A.9 LDA of the btissue data set

A.5.3 Feature Subset Selection

Feature subset selection is a topic of intense research. There
are many approaches to select a subset of features which can
improve model performance. It is not possible to cover all
such approaches as a part of this text. However, only for basic

feature selection functionalities, the FSelector package of R
can be used.

library(FSelector)

data <- iris

feat_subset <- cfs(Species ~ ., data) #
Selects feature subset using correlation
and entropy measures for continuous and
discrete data

Below is a programme to perform feature subset selection

before applying the same for training a model.

library(caret)

library(FSelector)

inputdata <- read.csv(�apndcts.csv�)

split = 0.7

set.seed(123)

trainIndex <- createDataPartition (y =
inputdata$class, p = split, list = FALSE)

train_ds <- inputdata [trainIndex,]

test_ds <- inputdata [-trainIndex,]

feat_subset <- cfs(class ~ ., train_ds)
#Feature selection done class <-

train_ds$class

train_ds <- cbind(train_ds[feat_subset],
class) # Subset training data created

class <- test_ds$class

test_ds <- cbind(test_ds[feat_subset],
class) # Subset test data created

train_ds$class <-
as.factor(train_ds$class)

test_ds$class <- as.factor(test_ds$class)

# Applying Decision Tree classifier

predict(model, test_ds, na.action =
na.pass)

cm <- confusionMatrix(predictions,
test_ds$class)

cm$overall[�Accuracy�]

Note:

The e1071 package is an important R package which
contains many statistical functions along with some critical
classification algorithms such as Na�ve Bayes and support
vector machine (SVM). It is created by David Meyer and
team and maintained by David Meyer.

A.6 MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

A.6.1 Supervised Learning � Classification

In Chapters 6, 7, and 8, conceptual overview of different
supervised learning algorithms has been presented. Now, you
will understand how to implement them using R. For the sake
of simplicity, the code for implementing each of the algorithms
is kept as consistent as possible. Also, we have used
benchmark data sets from UCI repository (these data sets will
also be available online, refer to the URL
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml).

A.6.1.1 Na�ve Bayes classifier

To implement this classifier, the naiveBayes function of the
e1071 package has been used. The full code for the
implementation is given below.

> cm$overall[�Accuracy�]

Output Accuracy:

0.8387097

A.6.1.2 kNN classifier

To implement this classifier, the knn function of the class
package has been used. The full code for the implementation is
given below.

A.6.2 Supervised Learning � Regression

As discussed in Chapter 9, two main algorithms used for
regression are simple linear regression and multiple linear
regression. Implementation of both the algorithms in R code is
shown below.

> data <- read.csv(�auto-mpg.csv�)

> attach(data) # Data set is attached to
the R search path, which means that while
evaluating a variable, objects in the data
set can be accessed by simply giving their
names. So, instead of �data$mpg�, simply
giving �mpg� will suffice.

data[!is.na(as.numeric(as.character(horsep
ower))),]

as.numeric(horsepower))

A.6.3 Unsupervised Learning

To implement the k-means algorithm, the k-means function of
the cluster package has been used. Also, because silhouette
width is a more generic performance measure, it has been used
here. The complete R code for the implementation is given
below.

> library (cluster)

> data <- read.csv(�spinem.csv�)

Programming Machine Learning in
Python

B.1 PRE-REQUISITES

B.1.1 Install anaconda in your system

Before starting to do machine learning programming in
Python, please install Python Anaconda distribution from
https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python. To write any python
script, open any text editor and write your python script and
save with the extension .py. You may also use the Spyder
(Scientific PYthon Development EnviRonment), which is a
powerful and interactive development environment for the
Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing,
debugging, and introspection features. In this chapter, all the
examples have been created working in Spyder.

B.1.2 Know how to manage Python scripts

Open new/pre-existing .py script in Spyder as shown in Figure B.1:

B.1.3 Know how to do basic programming using Python

B.1.3.1 Introduction to basic Python commands

First install a couple of basic libraries of Python namely

�os� for using operating system dependent functions
�pandas� for extensive data manipulation functionalities

In general, Annaconda Python by default contains all the
basic required packages for starting programming in machine
learning. But in case, any extra package is needed, �pip� is the
recommended installer.

Copyright � 2018. Python Software Foundation

FIG. B.1 Opening a script in Spyder

Command: pip install

Syntax: pip install �SomePackage�

After installing, libraries need to be loaded by invoking the
command:

Command: import <<library-name>>

Syntax: import os

Try out each of the following commands.

Note:

�#� is used for inserting inline comments

�+� is the assignment operator

B.1.3.2 Basic data types in Python

Python has five standard data types ?

1. Number
2. String
3. List
4. Tuple
5. Dictionary

Though Python has all the basic data types, Python

variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory
space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign
a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign
values to variables.

The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the

variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the
value stored in the variable. For example ?

>>> var1 = 4

>>> var2 = 8.83

>>> var3 = �Machine Learning�

>>> type(var1)

Out[38]: int

>>> print(var1)

4

>>> type(var2)

Out[39]: float

>>> print(var2)

8.83

>>> type(var3)

Out[40]: str

>>> print(var3)

Machine Learning

Python variables can be easily typecasted from one data

type to another by using its datatype name as a function
(actually a wrapper class) and passing the variable to be
typecasted as a parameter. But not all data types can be
transformed into another like String to integer/number is
impossible (that�s obvious!).

>>> var2 = int(var2)

>>> print (var2)

8

>>> type (var2)

Out[42]: int

>>> nrow_count = data.shape[0]    # To
find just the number of rows

>>> print(nrow_count)

>>> ncol_count = data.shape[1]    # To
find just the number of columns

>>> print(ncol_count)

>>> data.columns    # To get the columns
of a dataframe

Index([�mpg�, �cylinders�, �displacement�,
�horsepower�, �weight�, �acceleration�,
�model year�, �origin�, �car name�],

dtype=�object�)

>>> list(data.columns.values)# To list the
column names of a dataframe

We can also use:

>>> list(data)

[�mpg�,

�cylinders�,

�displacement�,

�horsepower�,

�weight�,

�acceleration�,

�model year�,

�origin�,

�car name�]

# To change the columns of a dataframe �

>>> data.columns = [�miles_per_gallon�,
�cylinders�, �displacement�, �horsepower�,
�weight�, �acceleration�, �model year�,
�origin�, �car name�]

Alternatively, we can use the following code:

>>> data.rename(columns={�displacement�:
�disp�}, inplace=True)

>>> data.head()    # By default displays
top 5 rows

>>> data.head(3)    # To display the top 3
rows

>>> data. tail ()    # By default displays
bottom 5 rows

>>> data. tail (3)    # To display the
bottom 3 rows

>>> data.at[200,�cylinders�] # Will return
cell value of the 200th row and column
�cylinders� of the data frame

6

Alternatively, we can use the following code:

>>> data.get_value(200,�cylinders�)

To select a specific column of a dataframe:

To select multiple columns of a dataframe:

To extract specific rows:

Bind sets of rows of dataframes:

Bind sets of columns of dataframes:

To save dataframes as .csv files:

>>> data3.to_csv(�data3.csv�) #Save
dataframe with index column

>>> data3.to_csv(�data3.csv�, index=False)
#Save dataframe without index column

Often, we get data sets with duplicate rows, which is nothing
but noise. Therefore, before training the model, we need to

make sure we get rid of such inconsistencies in the data set.
We can remove duplicate rows using code:

>>> data = data.drop_duplicates()

We frequently find missing values in our data set. We can drop
the rows/columns with missing values using the code below.

>>> data.dropna(axis=0, how=�all�) #Remove
all rows where values of all columns are
�NaN�

>>> data.dropna(axis=1, how=�all�) )
#Remove all columns where values of all
rows are �NaN�

>>> data.dropna(axis=0, how=�any�) #Remove
all rows where value of any column is
�NaN�

>>> data.dropna(axis=1, how=�any�) )
#Remove all columns where value of any row
is �NaN�

B.2 PREPARING TO MODEL

Now that we are kind of familiar with the basic Python
commands, we have the ability to start machine learning
programming in Python. But before starting to do actual
modelling work, we have to first understand the data using the
concepts highlighted in Chapter 2. Also, there might be some
issues in the data which you will unveil during data
exploration. You have to remediate that too.

So first, let�s find out how to do data exploration in Python.

There are two ways to explore and understand data:

1. By using certain statistical functions to understand the central tendency

and spread of the data

2. By visually observing the data in the form of plots or graphs

B.2.1 Basic statistical functions for data exploration

Let�s start with the first approach of understanding the data
through the statistical techniques. As we have seen in Chapter
2, for any data set, it is critical to understand the central
tendency and spread of the data. We have also seen the
standard statistical measures are as follows:

1. Measures of central tendency � Mean, median, mode
2. Measures of data spread

1. Dispersion of data � variance, standard deviation
2. Position of the different data values � quartiles, inter-quartile

range (IQR)

In Python, info function provides the structure of the data

frame along with the data types of the different attributes.
Also, there is a function describe which generates the
summary statistics of a data set. It gives the first basic
understanding of the data set which can trigger thought about
the data set and the anomalies that may be present. So, let�s
start off exploring a data set Auto MPG data set from the
University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning
repository. We will run the info and describe commands for the
Auto MPG data set.

Looking closely at the output of the describe command,
there are seven measures listed for the attributes (well, most of
them). These are

1. mean � mean of the specific attribute
2. std � Standard deviation of the specific attribute
3. min � minimum value of the attribute
4. 25% � First quartile (for details, refer to Chapter 2)
5. 50% � Median of the attribute
6. 75% � Third quartile (for details, refer to Chapter 2)
7. max � maximum value of the attribute

These gives a pretty good understanding of the data set
attributes. Now, note that one attribute � car.name, has a data
type object whereas the remaining attributes have either
integer or float data type. Why is that so? This is because this
attribute is a categorical attribute while the other ones are
numeric.

Note:

Numpy is a Python library which is used for scientific
computing. It contains among other things � a powerful
array object, mathematical and statistical functions, and
tools for integrating with C/C++ and Fortran code.

Let�s try to explore if any variable has any problem with the
data values where a cleaning may be required. As discussed in
Chapter 2, there may be two primary data issues � missing
values and outliers.

Let�s first try to figure out if there is any missing value for

any of the attributes. Let�s use a small piece of Python code
find out if there is any missing/unwanted value for an attribute
in the data. If there is, return the rows in which the attribute

has missing/unwanted values. Checking for all the attributes,
we find that the attribute �horsepower� has missing values.

There are six rows in the data set which have missing values
for the attribute �horsepower�. We will have to remediate these
rows before we proceed with the modelling activities. We will
do that shortly.

The easiest and most effective way to detect outliers is from
the box plot of the attributes. In the box plot, outliers are very
clearly highlighted. When we explore the attributes using box
plots in a short while, we will have a clear view of this.

We can get the other statistical measure of the attributes

using the following Python commands from the Numpy
library:

>>> np.mean(data[[�mpg�]])

23.514573

>>> np.median(data[[�mpg�]])

23.0

>>> np.var(data[[�mpg�]])

60.936119

>>> np.std(data[[�mpg�]])

7.806159

Note:

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python
programming language which produces 2D plots to render
visualization and helps in exploring the data sets. mat-
plotlib.pyplot is a collection of command style functions
that make matplotlib work like MATLAB

B.2.2 Basic plots for data exploration

In order to start using the library functions of matplotlib, we
need to include the library as follows:

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Let�s now understand the different graphs that are used for
data exploration and how to generate them using Python code.

We will use the �iris� data set, a very popular data set in the

machine learning world. This data set consists of three
different types of iris flower: Setosa, Versicolour, and
Virginica, the columns of the data set being - Sepal Length,
Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. For using this
data set, we will first have to import the Python library
datasets using the code below.

>>> from sklearn import datasets

# import some data to play with

>>> iris = datasets.load_iris()

B.2.2.1 Box plot

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

>>> X = iris.data[:, :4]

>>> plt.boxplot(X)

>>> plt.show()

A box plot for each of the four predictors is generated as
shown in Figure B.2.

FIG. B.2 Box plot for an entire data set

As we can see, Figure B.2 gives the box plot for the entire
iris data set i.e. for all the features in the iris data set, there is a
component or box plot in the overall plot. However, if we want
to review individual features separately, we can do that too
using the following Python command.

>>> plt.boxplot(X[:, 1])

>>> plt.show()

The output of the command i.e. the box plot of an individual
feature, sepal width, of the iris data set is shown in Figure B.3.

FIG. B.3 Box plot for a specific feature

To find out the outliers of an attribute, we can use the code
below:

B.2.2.2 Histogram

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

>>> X = iris.data[:, :1]

>>> plt.hist(X)

>>> plt.xlabel(�Sepal length�)

>>> plt.show()

The output of the command, i.e. the histogram of an

individual feature, Sepal Length, of the iris data set is shown
in Figure B.4.

FIG. B.4 Histogram for a specific feature

B.2.2.3 Scatterplot

>>> X = iris.data[:, :4] # We take the
first 4 features

>>> y = iris.target

>>> plt.scatter(X[:, 2], X[:, 0], c=y,
cmap=plt.cm.Set1, edgecolor=�k�)

>>> plt.xlabel(�Petal length�)

>>> plt.ylabel(�Sepal length�)

>>> plt.show()

The output of the command, i.e. the scatter plot for the
feature pair petal length and sepal length of the iris data set is
shown in Figure B.5.

FIG. B.5 Scatter plot of Petal Length vs. Sepal Length

B.2.3 Data pre-processing

The primary data pre-processing activities are remediating
data issues related to outliers and missing values. Also, feature
subset selection is quite a critical area of data pre-processing.
Let�s understand how to write programs for achieving these
purposes.

B.2.3.1 Handling outliers and missing values

As we saw in Chapter 2, the primary measures for remediating
outliers and missing values are

Removing specific rows containing outliers/missing values
Imputing the value (i.e. outliers/missing value) with a standard statistical
measure, e.g. mean or median or mode for that attribute
Estimate the value (i.e. outlier / missing value) based on value of the
attribute in similar records and replace with the estimated value.

Cap the values within 1.5 X IQR limits

B.2.3.1.1 Removing outliers / missing values

We have to first identify the outliers. We have already seen in
boxplots that outliers are clearly found out when we draw the
box plot of a specific attribute. Hence, we can use the same
concept as shown in the following code:

>>> outliers = plt.boxplot(X[:, 1])
[�fliers�][0].get_data()[1]

There is an alternate option too. As we know, outliers have

abnormally high or low value from other elements. So the
other option is to use threshold values to detect outliers so that
they can be removed. A sample code is given below.

def find_outlier(ds, col):

quart1 = ds[col].quantile(0.25)

quart3 = ds[col].quantile(0.75)

IQR = quart3 - quart1 #Inter-quartile

range

low_val = quart1 - 1.5*IQR

high_val = quart3 + 1.5*IQR

ds = ds.loc[(ds[col] < low_val) |

(ds[col] > high_val)]

return ds

>>> outliers = find_outlier(data, �mpg�)

Then those rows can be removed using the code:

def remove_outlier(ds, col):

quart1 = ds[col].quantile(0.25)

quart3 = ds[col].quantile(0.75)

IQR = quart3 - quart1 #Interquartile

range

low_val = quart1 - 1.5*IQR

high_val = quart3 + 1.5*IQR

df_out = ds.loc[(ds[col] > low_val) &

(ds[col] < high_val)]

return df_out

>>> data = remove_outlier(data, �mpg�)

Rows having missing values can be removed using the code:

>>> data.dropna(axis=0, how=�any�) #Remove
all rows where value of any column is
�NaN�

B.2.3.1.2 Imputing standard values

The code for identification of outliers or missing values will
remain the same. For imputation, depending on which

statistical function is to be used for imputation, code will be as
follows:

Only the affected rows are identified and the value of the

attribute is transformed to the mean value of the attribute.

>>> hp_mean = np.mean(data[�horsepower�])

>>> imputedrows =
data[data[�horsepower�].isnull()]

>>> imputedrows =
imputedrows.replace(np.nan, hp_mean)

Then the portion of the data set not having any missing row is
kept apart.

>>> missval_removed_rows =
data.dropna(subset=[�horsepower�])

Then join back the imputed rows and the remaining part of the
data set.

>>> data_mod =
missval_removed_rows.append(imputedrows,
ignore_index=True)

In a similar way, outlier values can be imputed. Only
difference will be in identification of the relevant rows.

B.2.3.1.3 Capping of values

The code for identification of outliers values will remain the
same. For capping, generally a value 1.5 times the (inter-

quartile range) IQR is to be used for imputation, code will be
as follows:

Note:

Scikit-learn (�SciKit� = SciPy Toolkit) is a machine
learning library for the Python programming language. It
contains various classification, regression and clustering
algorithms including support vector machines, random
forests, gradient boosting, k-means, etc. Built on NumPy,
SciPy, and matplotlib, it is designed to interoperate
smoothly between the libraries.

B.3 MODEL TRAINING

B.3.1 Holdout

The first step before starting to model, in case of supervised
learning, is to load the input data, hold out a portion of the
input data as test data and have the remaining portion as
training data for building the model. Below is the standard

way to do it. Scikit-learn provides a function to split input data
set into training and test data sets.

>>> import pandas as pd

>>> data = pd.read_csv(�btissue.csv�)

>>> from sklearn.model_selection import
train_test_split

>>> data.shape

(106, 10)

>>> data_train, data_test =
train_test_split(data, test_size = 0.3,
random_state = 123) # The parameter
test_size sets the ratio of test data to
the input data to 0.3 or 30% and
random_state sets the seed for random
number generator

>>> len(data_train)

74

>>> len(data_test)

32

Note:

When we do data holdout, i.e. splitting of the input data
into training and test data sets, the records selected for
each set are picked randomly. So, it is obvious that
executing the same code may result in different training
data set. So the model trained will also be somewhat
different. In Python Scikit function train_test_split, the
parameter random_state sets the starting point of the
random number generator used internally to pick the
records. This ensures that random numbers of a specific
sequence is used every time and hence the same records
(i.e. records having same sequence number) are picked
every time and the model is trained in the same way. This
is extremely critical for the reproducibility of results i.e.
every time, the same machine learning program generates
the same set of results.

B.3.2 K-fold cross-validation

Let�s do k-fold cross-validation with 10 folds. For creating the
cross-validation, there are two options. KFold function of
either sklearn.cross_validation or sklearn.model_ selection can
be used as follows:

>>> import pandas as pd

>>> data = pd.read_csv(�auto-mpg.csv�)

# Option 1

>>> from sklearn.cross_validation import
KFold

>>> kf = KFold(data.shape[0], n_folds=10,
random_state=123)

>>> for train_index, test_index in kf:

  data_train = data.iloc[train_index]

  data_test = data.iloc[test_index]

# Option 2

>>> from sklearn.model_selection import
KFold

>>> kf = KFold(n_splits=10)

>>> for train, test in kf.split(data):

  data_train = data.iloc[train_index]

  data_test = data.iloc[test_index]

B.3.3 Bootstrap sampling

As discussed in Capter 3, bootstrap resampling is used to
generate samples of any given size from the training data. It
uses the concept of simple random sampling with repetition.
To generate bootstrap sample in Python, resample function of
sklearn.utils library can be used. Below is a sample code

>>> import pandas as pd

>>> from sklearn.utils import resample

>>> data = pd.read_csv(�btissue.csv�)

>>> X = data.iloc[:,0:9]

>>> X

>>> resample(X, n_samples=200,
random_state=0) # Generates a sample of
size 200 (as mentioned in parameter
n_samples) with repetition �

B.3.4 Training the model

Once the model preparatory steps, like data holdout, etc. are
over, the actual training happens. The sklearn framework in
Python provides most of the models which are generally used
in machine learning. Below is a sample code.

>>> from sklearn.tree import
DecisionTreeClassifier

>>> predictors = data.iloc[:,0:7]   #
Segregating the predictors

>>> target = data.iloc[:,7]   #
Segregating the target/class

>>> predictors_train, predictors_test,
target_train, target_test =
train_test_split(predictors, target,

test_size = 0.3, random_state = 123) #
Holdout of data

>>> dtree_entropy =
DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion =
�entropy�, random_state = 100,
max_depth=3, min_samples_leaf=5) #Model is
initialized

# Finally the model is trained

>>> model =
dtree_entropy.fit(predictors_train,
target_train)

B.3.5 Evaluating model performance

B.3.5.1 Supervised learning - classification

As we have already seen in Chapter 3, the primary measure of
performance of a classification model is its accuracy.
Accuracy of a model is calculated based on correct
classifications made by the model compared to total number of
classifications. In Python, sklearn.metrics provides
accuracy_score functionality to evaluate the accuracy of a
classification model. Below is the code for evaluating the
accuracy of a classifier model.

>>> prediction =
rf.predict(predictors_test)

>>> accuracy_score(target_test,
prediction, normalize = True)

The confusion_matrix functionality of sklearn.metrics helps

in generation the confusion matrix, discussed in detail in
Chapter 3. Below is the code for finding the confusion matrix
of a classifier model. Also, in Figure B.6, is a quick analysis of
the output confusion matrix as obtained from the Python code.

>>> confusion_matrix(target_test,
prediction)

FIG. B.6 Performance evaluation of a classification model

B.3.5.2 Supervised learning - regression

We have seen in Chapter 3, R-squared is an effective measure
of performance of a regression model. In Python,
sklearn.metrics provides mean_squared_error and r2_score
functionality to evaluate the accuracy of a regression model.
Below is a sample code.

>>> prediction =
model.predict(predictors_test)

>>> mean_squared_error(target_test,
prediction)

>>> r2_score(target_test, prediction)

B.3.5.3 Unsupervised learning - clustering

As we have seen in Chapter 3, there are two popular measures
of cluster quality � purity and silhouette width. Purity can be
calculated only when class label is known for the data set
subjected to clustering. On the other hand, silhouette width can
be calculated for any data set.

Purity

We will use a Lower Back Pain Symptoms data set released by
Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sammy123/lower-back-pain-
symptoms-dataset). The data set consists of 310 observations,
13 attributes (12 numeric predictors, 1 binary class attribute).

>>> import pandas as pd

>>> import numpy as np

>>> from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

>>> from sklearn.metrics.cluster import
v_measure_score

>>> data = pd.read_csv(�spine.csv�)

>>> data_woc = data.iloc[:,0:12]    #
Stripping out the class variable from the
data set �

>>> data_class = data.iloc[:,12]    #
Segregating the target / class variable �

>>> f1 =
data_woc[�pelvic_incidence�].values

>>> f2 = data_woc[�pelvic_radius�].values

>>> f3 = data_woc[�thoracic_slope�].values

>>> X = np.array(list(zip(f1, f2, f3)))

>>> kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = 2,
random_state = 123)

>>> model = kmeans.fit(X)

>>> cluster_labels = kmeans.predict(X)

>>> v_measure_score(cluster_labels,
data_class)

Output

0.12267025741680369

Silhouette Width

For calculating Silhouette Width, silhouette_score function of
sklearn. metrics library can be used for calculating Silhouette
width. Below is the code for calculating Silhouette Width. A
full implementation can be found in a later section A.5.3.

>>> from sklearn.metrics import
silhouette_score

>>> sil = silhouette_score(X,
cluster_labels, metric =
�euclidean�,sample_size = len(data)) # �X�
is a feature matrix for the feature subset
selected for clustering and �data� is the
data set

B.4 FEATURE ENGINEERING

B.4.1 Feature construction

For doing feature construction, we can use pandas library of
Python. Following is a small code for implementing feature
construction.

>>> import pandas as pd

>>> room_length = [18, 20, 10, 12, 18, 11]

>>> room_breadth = [20, 20, 10, 11, 19,
10]

>>> room_type = [�Big�, �Big�, �Normal�,
�Normal�, �Big�, �Normal�]

>>> data = pd.DataFrame({�Length�:
room_length, �Breadth�: room_ breadth,
�Type�: room_type})

>>> data

B.4.1.1 Dummy coding categorical (nominal) variables:

get_dummies function of pandas library can be used to
dummy code categorical variables. Following is a sample code
for the same.

>>> import pandas as pd

>>> age = [18, 20, 23, 19, 18, 22]

>>> city = [�City A�, �City B�, �City B�,
�City A�, �City C�, �City B�]

>>> data = pd.DataFrame({�age�: age,
�city�: city})

>>> data

>>> dummy_features =
pd.get_dummies(data[�city�])

>>> data_age = pd.DataFrame(data = data,
columns = [�age�])

>>> data_mod =
pd.concat([data_age.reset_index(drop=True)
, dummy_ features], axis=1)

>>> data_mod

B.4.1.2 Encoding categorical (ordinal) variables:

LabelEncoder function of sklearn. preprocessing library can
be used to encode categorical variables. Following is a sample
code for the same.

>>> import pandas as pd

>>> from sklearn import preprocessing

>>> marks_science = [78,56,87,91,45,62]

>>> marks_maths = [75,62,90,95,42,57]

>>> grade = [�B�,�C�,�A�,�A�,�D�,�B�]

>>> data = pd.DataFrame({�Science marks�:
marks_science, �Maths marks�: marks_maths,
�Total grade�: grade})

>>> data

# Option 1

>>> le = preprocessing.LabelEncoder()

>>> le.fit(data[�Total grade�])

>>> data[�Total grade�] =
le.transform(data[�Total grade�])

>>> data

# Option 2

>>> target = data[�Total
grade�].replace([�A�,�B�,�C� ,�D�],
[0,1,2,3])

>>> predictors = data.iloc[:, 0:2]

>>> data_mod =
pd.concat([predictors.reset_index(drop=Tru
e), target], axis=1)

B.4.1.3 Transforming numeric (continuous) features to
categorical features:

>>> import pandas as pd

>>> apartment_area = [4720, 2430, 4368,
3969, 6142, 7912]

>>> apartment_price =
[2360000,1215000,2184000,1984500,3071000,3
956000]

>>> data = pd.DataFrame({�Area�:
apartment_area, �Price�: apartment_price})

>>> data

B.4.2 Feature extraction

B.4.2.1 Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

For doing principal component analysis or in other words � to
get the principal components of a set of features in a data set,
we can use PCA function of sklearn.decomposition library.
However, features should be standardized (i.e. transform to
unit scale with mean = 0 and variance = 1), for which
StandardScaler function of sklearn. preprocessing library can
be used. Following is the code using the iris data set. PCA
should be applied on the predictors. The target / class variable
can be used to visualize the principal components (Figure
B.7).

>>> import pandas as pd

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

>>> from sklearn import datasets

>>> from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

>>> from sklearn.preprocessing import
StandardScaler

>>> iris = datasets.load_iris()

>>> predictors = iris.data[:, 0:4]

>>> target = iris.target

>>> predictors =
StandardScaler().fit_transform(predictors)
# Standardizing the features

>>> pca = PCA(n_components=2)

>>> princomp =
pca.fit_transform(predictors)

>>> princomp_ds = pd.DataFrame(data =
princomp, columns = [�PC 1�, �PC 2�])

>>> princomp_ds

FIG. B.7 Principal components of iris data set

B.4.2.2 Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):

We have seen in Chapter 4 that singular value decomposition
of a matrix A (m X n) is a factorization of the form:

A = U?V = UsV  (representing ? or Sigma by �s�)

T

For implementing singular value decomposition in Python,

we can use svd function of scipy.linalg library. Following is
the code using the iris data set.

>>> import pandas as pd

>>> from sklearn import datasets

>>> from scipy.linalg import svd

>>> iris = datasets.load_iris()

>>> predictors = iris.data[:, 0:4]

>>> U, s, VT = svd(predictors)

>>> print(U)

B.4.2.3 Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):

For implementing singular value decomposition in Python, we
can use LinearDiscriminantAnalysis function of
sklearn.discriminant_analysis library. Following is the code
using the UCI data set btissue.

>>> import pandas as pd

>>> import numpy as np

>>> from sklearn import datasets

>>> from sklearn.discriminant_analysis
import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis

>>> from sklearn.utils import column_or_1d

>>> data = pd.read_csv(�btissue.csv�)

>>> X = data.iloc[:,0:9]

>>> y = column_or_1d(data[�class�],
warn=True) #To generate 1d array,
column_or_1d has been used �

>>> clf = LinearDiscriminantAnalysis()

>>> lda_fit = clf.fit(X, y)

>>> print(lda_fit)

LinearDiscriminantAnalysis(n_components=No
ne, priors=None,
shrinkage=None,solver=�svd�,
store_covariance=False, tol=0.0001)

>>> pred = clf.predict([[1588.000000,
0.085908, -0.086323, 516.943603,

>>> print(pred)

[�con�]

B.4.3 Feature subset selection

Feature subset selection is a topic of intense research. There
are many approaches to select a subset of features which can
improve model performance. It is not possible to cover all
such approaches as a part of this text. However,
sklearn.feature_selection module can be used for applying
basic feature selection. There are multiple options of feature
selection offered by the module, one of which is presented
below:

>>> import pandas as pd

>>> import numpy as np

>>> from sklearn.feature_selection import
SelectKBest

>>> from sklearn.feature_selection import
chi2

>>> data = pd.read_csv(�apndcts.csv�)

>>> predictors = data.iloc[:,0:7] #
Seggretating the predictor variables �

>>> target = data.iloc[:,7]    #
Seggretating the target / class variable �

>>> test = SelectKBest(chi2, k=2)

>>> fit = test.fit(predictors, target)

>>> features = fit.transform(predictors)

>>> print(predictors.columns)

>>> np.set_printoptions(precision=3)

>>> print(fit.scores_)

Output:

Index([�At1�, � At2�, � At3�, � At4�, �
At5�, � At6�, � At7�], dtype=�object�)

Scores for each feature:

[ 1.771 1.627 2.391 1.084 1.673 1.647
2.236]

B.5 MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

B.5.1 Supervised learning - classification

In the chapter 6, 7, and 8, conceptual overview of different
supervised learning algorithms has been presented. Now, you
will get to know, how to implement them using Python. For
the sake of simplicity, we have tried to keep the code for
implementing each of the algorithms as consistent as possible.

Also, we have used benchmark data sets from UCI repository
(will also keep it available online).

library of sklearn.naive_ bayes has been used. The full code
for the implementation is given below.

For implementing neural network in Python, neurolab is a
great option. It is a simple and powerful neural network library
for Python. You can install neurolab by using the command
below from the command prompt:

Let�s first implement a single layer feed forward neural
network. We can use the same set of data as provided as an
example in Chapter 10, Section 10.6.2. The data is as below
and output shown in Figure B.10.

p1 = (5, 2) and p2 = (-1, 12) belonging to c1
p3 = (3, -5) and p4 = (-2, -1) belonging to c2

This can summarized as

So let�s do the programming now.

>>> import neurolab as nl

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Plot
results

>>> input = [[5, 2], [-1, 12], [3, -5],
[-2, -1]]

>>> target = [[1], [1], [2], [2]]

# Create single layer neural net with 2
inputs and 1 neuron

>>> net = nl.net.newp([[-2, 12],[1, 2]],
1) # Function newp is for implementing
single layer perceptron �

Next let�s implement a multi layer feed forward neural
network. We can have multiple hidden layers in this case. In
this case, we will use multi layer neural network as a regressor
i.e. to predict a continuous variable. A set of 75 values of
predictor variable is first generated within a specified range.
The corresponding target values are generated using the
equation y = 4x  + 7.6 and normalized. Using these set of
points, a multi layer neural network is trained. Then using the
trained model, predictions are generated and compared with
the actual data points generated from the regression function.

WISE SCHEDULE

Below is the proposed structure for a machine learning lab
using Python.

Appendix C

A Case Study on Machine Learning
Application: Grouping Similar Service
Requests and Classifying a New One

In the previous two appendices, we have discussed how R and
Python can be used to create the machine learning algorithms.
We also talked about different sets of libraries available for
easy deployment of machine learning. With that perspective,
let�s now see how machine learning is used in real life to solve
a business problem, which otherwise would have taken
significant manual effort.

C.1 BUSINESS CASE

In a telecom service center, the operators are responsible for
providing the technical resolution to the problems that the
customers face. Recently, due to huge surge in telecom user
base, the service center of Newtel Infocomm is facing a huge
challenge in dealing with the increase in service request
volume. Newtel has two options � either it can increase the
number of operators, thus increasing the operating cost
substantially. Alternatively, it can explore if technology can
help to solve the problem, without much additional cost, and
thus help it remain profitable. The service center of Newtel
engaged Global Tech (GT), a company known for providing
state-of-the-art machine learning solutions to solve customer

problems. After careful review of the problem and the
underlying root cause, GT come up with a Machine Learning
solution, briefly highlighted below.

C.2 SOLUTION APPROACH

GT observed that there are many service requests coming to
Newtel service centers, which are repetitive in nature in terms
of the type of problem. This was evident from the text of the
service requests. Also, in most of the cases, there are some
standard steps that the customer needs to follow to get the
issue resolved. So, GT experts inferred, that buckets of service
requests can be created through machine learning algorithm
based on the past service requests. For each bucket, a set of
corresponding standard resolutions can be associated.
Whenever a new service request comes to Newtel service
center, another machine learning algorithm should identify the
bucket to which the new request should be tagged to, pull out
the corresponding standard resolution, and send it to the
customer. All these will happen without any human
intervention. So, additional call volumes can be handled
without any additional personnel in place. This will
significantly reduce the additional manpower requirement
leading to an impact on operating cost and profitability.

In the solution provided by GT, service requests in the

repository were clustered using a combination of text analytics
of select descriptive fields, time taken to resolve each request,
and a user-selected categorical variable. The specific text
analytics technique chosen was Word2Vector and the
clustering technique was DBSCAN. For text classification to
classify the new service request to one of the buckets created,
Cosine Similarity algorithm was used. Let�s review the
technical solution in some more details.

(I) Getting Python ready

Algorithm:

1. Load required libraries of Python. These sets of libraries are needed to

load data, perform computations and display output. Some of the
important libraries are

1. Pandas�Data analysis library
2. numpy�array processing library in Python
3. nltk.data and nltk.corpus�Natural language processing library
4. import genism�for text analytics and clustering we will be

converting word to vector. Word2vec function implemented by
genism is useful here

5. from gensim.models import word2vec
6. from gensim.models.keyedvectors import KeyedVectors
7. matplotlib.pyplot�To visualize the clusters
8. from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN�For clustering
9. from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity�To

compute service request description similarity

Sample code snippet

(II) Data load

Algorithm:

Based on the source of data, like spreadsheet or csv dump of
service requests or a direct access to service request database,
load the data into the program in form of array of strings. The
csv file containing the data set is available as online material
for this book. The structure of the file is given below:

Code snippet

(III) Filtering for the assignment groups listed by the

business users. This will ensure that the clusters are
created as per business units.

Algorithm:

Identify the information from the data set that can help in
making the data categorization or the clustering easy. In our
example, we will use the service center�s assignment group or
department as the driver for clustering. Below is some
example of the assignment groups that can categorize the
service requests.

Code snippet

(IV) Text analytics to create the training data for

machine learning algorithm.

Algorithm:

1. Create training data by averaging vectors for the words in the SR.
2. Calculate the average feature vector for each one and return a 2D

numpy array.

3. This array set is now your training data for running the clustering.

Code snippet

(IV) Running the clustering

Algorithm:

DBSCAN algorithm is used for this clustering which will take
the density-based clustering approach. The position of vectors
created above are checked and the high-density areas are taken
as a new cluster whereas clusters are separated by low-density
areas.

Code snippet

The cluster that is generated as the result of DBSCAN is
shown in Figure C.1. The estimated number of clusters: 14 and
Silhouette Coefficient: 0.367

FIG. C.1 Clustering output

(V) New SR assigned to correct bucket � Cosine

similarity function

Algorithm:

1. Create the vector from the description text of the SR using word2vec

function

2. Calculate the similarity score for the vector using the cosine_similarity

function

3. Find the cluster the service request is assigned to, based on the max
similarity score, averaged across all service requests in the cluster

4. If no cluster is found matching this SR vector, then this SR is unlike any

in the training repository and is not assigned to any cluster

Code snippet

C.3 OUTCOME

The service request processing of Newtel Infocomm has been
automated now. GT has used machine learning technique to
achieve the automation. As a part of the solution, the unlabeled
service requests have been grouped into logical clusters using

the DBSCAN algorithm. Also, whenever any new service
request arrives, the cosine similarity algorithm finds out the
relevant bucket for it so that some predefined, standard
resolution can be sent automatically to the customer. There can
be more such ways to solve this same business problem, as
well as many scenarios which can be addressed through this
same approach. So, look out for real-life business problems
and think about automating the resolutions thorough intelligent
use of machine learning.

variable which indicates whether somebody is an intruder (i = 1)
or not (i = 0) and A with a ? {0, 1} be the variable indicating
alarm. An alarm will be raised if an intruder is identified with
probability P (A = 1| I = 1) = 0.98, a non-intruder with
probability P (A = 1| I = 0) = 0.001 which implies the error
factor. In the population of passengers, the probability of

customers and take a photograph. Though there is continuous
flow of customers we create bins of timeframe of 5 minutes each.
In each time frame of 5 min there may be a customer moving into
the bank with probability 5%, or there is no customer (again, for
simplicity we assume that either there is 1 customer or none, not
the case of multiple customers). If there is a customer, it will be
detected by the CCTV with a probability of 99%. If there is no
customer, the camera will take false photograph by detecting
other thing�s movement with a probability of 10%. How many
customers enter the bank on average per day (10 hours)? How
many false photographs (there is a photograph taken even though
there is no customer) and how many missed photographs (there is
no photograph even though there is a customer) are there on
average per day.
